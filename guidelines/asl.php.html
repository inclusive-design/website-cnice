<hr />

<a id="4.1" name="4.1"></a>
<h2>4.1 Introduction</h2>
<p>Video communication or video conferencing is becoming a much more commonly 
	used and effective means of interpersonal communication (Finn, Sellen &amp; 
	Wilbur, 1997) such as for distance learning, business meetings and social 
	communication. As hardware becomes more available and less expensive, and 
	software, signal processing and compression technologies become more stable 
	and efficient, there is an increasing interest and experimentation with the 
	technology by the general public and by business.</p>
<p>Video communication technology is designed to support real-time communication 
	between one or more users when long distances separate them. Video-mediated 
	communications, as well as other forms of remote interpersonal communication 
	(e.g., traditional telephony, email, and audio-only communication) are distinctive 
	by the nature of the medium from which they are constituted (Olson, Olson 
	&amp; Meader, 1997). Each form of communication has particular strengths and 
	weaknesses. The goal in using a particular communication medium is not to 
	replicate identically that which can be easily achieved when interlocutors 
	are face-to-face. Rather, it is to find ways to provide participants with 
	a means to achieve all the interactions that are necessary to complete the 
	defined task in a productive and efficient manner. We need to understand the 
	strengths and weaknesses of each medium of communication in order optimize 
	its use and find ways in which to overcome their weaknesses.</p>
<p>One of the strengths of video conferencing technology is the opportunity it 
	offers people with disabilities to communicate with each other, with service 
	providers and with business associates without having to travel. One important 
	benefit relates to sign language users, who can communicate in their own language 
	(using their own cultural expressions and dynamics) with each other and with 
	people who are hearing and at a distance. </p>
<p>ASL speakers living in remote communities can now have access to and participate 
	in Deaf culture where Deaf cultural events are often limited to urban settings 
	with a large population of ASL speakers. Other telecommunications technologies 
	such as the telephone, TTY devices and synchronous chat use text and so do 
	not allow sign language users to communicate in their first language. For 
	people who use sign as their primary language, text based expressions of a 
	spoken language like English should be a viewed as second language and as 
	such is a significantly less expressive and intuitive language for sign language 
	users. Through video communication technology, sign language users can now 
	have access to a more equitable means of communication. Sign language users 
	have been experimenting with video mediated communication for some time and 
	many lessons have been learned to mitigate some difficulties encountered with 
	video conferencing technologies.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that people with disabilities are adequately served by video 
	conferencing technologies and remote meeting procedures we must ensure that 
	the technology and procedures are inclusive and accessible. Guidelines that 
	have been established for video conferencing situations may not be inclusive 
	particularly for users who are deaf. Researchers at Gallaudet University have 
	devised some guidelines to assist sign language users in experiencing more 
	effective one-on-one video mediated signed communication (Williams, 2002) 
	based on the findings and recommendations of the above research. However, 
	these guidelines only apply in one-on-one situations with small field-of-view 
	cameras; they have not been extrapolated to one-to-many situations with high 
	end technology or where there is an interpretation need &#8211; a potentially 
	common application. </p>
<p>While video conferencing technologies offer exciting opportunities to support 
	people with disabilities, there is a dearth of research, case studies and 
	best practice literature to support the procurement, installation, management 
	and operation of inclusive video conferencing services. This report provides 
	a set of guidelines and best practice statements that will assist organizations 
	and individuals in establishing accessible video conferencing. </p>
<p>In this document, there is a focus on guidelines for users who are sign language 
	users or who are hard of hearing. These two groups of people have the greatest 
	variety of unique needs for video conferencing. Lack of accessibility therefore 
	has the greatest impact on them. In this document, we provide an overview 
	of the technology, a description of remote sign language interpretation issues 
	and requirements, small case studies and user reports. Specific access issues 
	are identified and discussed followed by guidelines and recommendations to 
	address these issues. Many of these recommendations are based on our experiences 
	since 2003 using high-end video conferencing for remote interpretation.</p>
<br />
<a id="4.2" name="4.2"></a>
<h2>4.2 Technology Overview</h2>
<p>Before addressing the unique aspects of video communication for people with 
	disabilities, we will provide a brief review of common video communication 
	technologies. There is a standard and common set of hardware technologies 
	and configurations for video conferencing regardless of how the system is 
	used and who the users may be. First, video conferencing relies on having 
	network connectivity so that video and audio signals can be transmitted in 
	real-time over a distance (often over long distances).</p>
<p>There are two main types of network transmission technologies used for video 
	conferencing, Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and Internet Protocols 
	(IP). ISDN, introduced in 1984, is designed to allow fast digital point-to-point 
	connections over the public telephone network (Total Access Networks, 2004). 
	Video communication signal processing and transmission are guided by the International 
	Telecommunication&#8217;s Union (ITU) H.320 video standards (Polycom, 2001). 
	Guaranteed and consistent quality of service is provided by ISDN as the signal 
	does not fluctuate with network availability because it is a continuous feed 
	and direct connection. Common transmission speeds for ISDN used in video conferencing 
	applications range from 128 kilobits per second (kbps) to 384 kbps. These 
	transmission speeds allow audio-video signals to be consistently transmitted 
	at near broadcast quality (broadcast quality video transmission is 29.95 frames 
	per second (fps)). The cost of this service is based on a monthly line charge 
	(e.g., for 128 kbps service, two 64 kbps lines are required) plus &#8220;on 
	air&#8221; charges per minute. Video conferencing is &#8220;on-air&#8221; 
	as soon as a connection is made and is only disconnected when the video conference 
	is complete. </p>
<p>IP videoconferencing involves using Internet Protocols and technologies to 
	process and transmit live video and audio signals. Video conferencing using 
	IP protocols is governed by the ITU H.323 video standard (Polycom, 2001). 
</p>
<p>Internet protocols (IP) require that data signals are divided into small data 
	packets and routed through various available networks rather than through 
	the continuous feed, direct point-to-point connection available with ISDN. 
	The IP video conferencing signals must share the network with all of the other 
	Internet traffic resulting in inconsistent and fluctuating quality of the 
	video and audio signals (ranging from 2 to 29.95 fps). As a result, high-speed 
	Internet connectivity is required to have effective IP-based video conferencing. 
	Much research and development effort has been placed in developing technical 
	solutions for improving the quality of service for IP video conferencing. 
	Some of this research that has met with some success includes better compression 
	and signal processing techniques (Muresan, et al., 2002), and ways of assigning 
	transmission priorities to video and audio signals (Babich &amp; Vitez, 2000). 
</p>
<p>Gatekeeper technology is a network device that provides addressing service 
	for H.323 (Internet-based) videoconference clients. It may also be configured 
	to impose network bandwidth restrictions and to allow or disallow a call. 
	Registration by the videoconference client usually takes place when the client 
	is started; the address of the gatekeeper is put into the client's configuration. 
	Use of a gatekeeper allows a videoconference device to &quot;dial&quot; another 
	device using the videoconference address rather than an IP address (which 
	could be changed by DHCP). Gatekeeper services might include bandwidth and 
	call management. Bandwidth controls the number of H.323 terminals permitted 
	simultaneous access to a LAN. Call Management maintains a list of active H.323 
	calls. This information indicates when a called terminal is busy, and provides 
	information for the bandwidth management function. One or more gatekeepers 
	may reside anywhere on the network, fully integrated into another networking 
	device or operating as a standalone software application on a desktop computer. 
</p>
<p>Costs for IP-based video conferencing can be significantly lower than ISDN 
	and are mostly related to the speed or bandwidth of connectivity rather than 
	the length of time the video conference is in session. Cable modem or Digital 
	Subscriber Line (DSL) connectivity is generally available and relatively inexpensive, 
	and would be considered as the minimum bandwidth required. Similar to ISDN 
	cost structure, the cost of this service is also based on a monthly rate plus 
	&#8220;on-air&#8221; per minute charge for use. However, these costs are considerably 
	less than ISDN because of the shared nature of IP-based networks. High-speed 
	networks, and/or fibre-based Ethernets only improve the quality and reliability 
	of video conferencing but costs are significantly increased.</p>
<p>A multipoint videoconference allows more than one site to connect at the same 
	time. A multipoint videoconference involving 3 or more sites is possible through 
	the use of a bridge or multipoint control unit (MCU). Some pre-configured 
	systems such as the Polycom FX have built-in bridges which allow you to connect 
	to multiple sites. Third party services such as Bell Canada bridge services 
	can be rented on an hourly basis.</p>
<p>The video communication system itself consists of two subsystems, one at each 
	end of the network connection. Each subsystem is composed of at least one 
	video camera with optional zoom controls, microphones (desktop or wireless), 
	speakers, a small preview screen (picture-in-picture capability), and monitors 
	or large screen televisions. These subsystems can be PC-based such as iVisit 
	and Netmeeting setups or can be dedicated hardware such as a PolyCom&#8482; 
	ViaVideo&reg; II. Many sources are available to describe the characteristics 
	of the various hardware/software options (e.g., Video Development Initiative&#8217;s 
	Video Conferencing Cookbook, (VIDe, 2004) is a good source for general detailed 
	information about video conferencing hardware). </p>
<p>There are many different types of subsystem hardware that range in quality 
	and cost. The simplest and least costly hardware is a webcam (at $50.00) and 
	PC-microphone. Often this type of hardware is &#8220;plug and play&#8221; 
	technology that is directly accepted by the computer. As a result this type 
	of setup can be installed directly and used immediately with software such 
	as NetMeeting or iVisit. However, this type of hardware has few controls and 
	adjustments. For example, a simple webcam may be limited to focus control 
	(there are not lighting, motion or zoom controls).</p>
<p>The audio system for video conferencing consists of some combination of audio 
	headset, telephone handset, microphones, speakers, and digitising devices 
	(hardware and software). One of the most traditional microphones in video 
	conferencing is the lavaliere microphone, which is a miniature microphone 
	that you clip onto the clothing of the person speaking. Wearing a lavaliere 
	microphone reduces the feedback noise that is picked up by the other type 
	of microphones. A second common type of microphone is the room microphone, 
	which is a unidirectional boundary microphone. These microphones lie on the 
	surface of a conference table or desk. They detect speech with a clear, natural 
	sound. This type of microphone is specially designed to filter out room acoustics 
	&#8211; much more so than a conventional microphone on a desk stand. A third 
	microphone type that is often used with desktop video conferencing is the 
	stick microphone or microphone built into the camera. Such microphones lack 
	good audio quality and can effectively shut down a video conferencing. These 
	types of microphones are the least expensive audio solutions but they are 
	also the lowest quality. There is no adjustment in the echo or gain features 
	for these microphones.</p>
<p>As the quality of the camera and microphone setup increases there is a corresponding 
	increase in functionality, controls and the cost of the hardware. For example, 
	a top of the line camera may cost $2,500 but will have a considerable number 
	of functions such as zoom, pan and tilt controls, back light, and automatic 
	tracking. In addition, the optics system in these types of cameras is of a 
	much higher quality than typical webcams. These types of cameras are typically 
	used with systems that allow remote control of camera functions so that the 
	remote participant can control the zoom, pan and tilt functions of the remote 
	camera.</p>
<a id="4.2.1" name="4.2.1"></a>
<h3>4.2.1 Connecting IP technologies with ISDN </h3>
<p>IP video conferencing systems and ISDN systems can be connected together using 
	a gateway communication system. A gateway offers the most flexible link between 
	ISDN (H.320) and IP (H.323) videoconferencing standards and delivers full 
	interoperability between ISDN and IP endpoints. The Gateway integrates seamlessly 
	to provide H.323 management and to control network capacity. For instance, 
	you can conduct conference calls seamlessly from any endpoint to any other 
	endpoint &#8211; regardless of system type or network configuration.</p>
<a id="4.2.2" name="4..2.2"></a>
<h3>4.2.2 Bandwidth recommendations</h3>
<p>Videoconferencing requires a large amount of data to be transmitted in a short 
	amount of time. The recommended minimum amount of bandwidth is 384kbps for 
	a typical business quality videoconference.</p>
<p>The main consideration for any video conference is how many frames per second 
	are being transmitted. A good quality video conference requires 30 frames 
	per second video transmission.</p>
<p>Any data rate higher than or equal to 384 kbps will support a video screen 
	update of 30 frames per second, equivalent to VCR playback quality television. 
</p>
<p>Any data rate lower than 384 kbps will support a video screen update of 15 
	frames per second or less, which is still usable, but will appear slightly 
	jerky under rapid motion.</p>
<a id="4.2.3" name="4.2.3"></a>
<h3>4.2.3 Applications</h3>
<p>A typical video conferencing interface is based on a telephone metaphor where 
	remote participants are connected using telephone or telephone-like (IP address) 
	numbers. Terminology such as dialing, hanging up, answer, busy, and address 
	book is used to refer to the connecting tasks accomplished by users with the 
	system. Unique aspects of the interface include video displays (local and 
	remote windows) where the local window often appears as a picture-in-picture 
	window in the main video window. Settings menus are often available to customise 
	the look and placement of the video windows, and to adjust various technical 
	properties such as compression quality or levels, video and audio settings 
	and controls, and file management. On the high-end video conference interfaces 
	there are also specialized camera settings for remote and local camera controls 
	and automatic speaker detection.</p>
<p>Video conferencing can involve more than just the real-time transmission of 
	audio and video images. Applications such as file and application sharing, 
	logging audio and video, capturing and sending of static images, simultaneous 
	text chat can be incorporated into video conferencing software. While all 
	of these applications can be very useful in supporting work group needs, they 
	can also interfere with communication strategies. In addition, appropriate 
	access to all of these applications must be included for people with disabilities.</p>
<a id="4.2.4" name="4.2.4"></a>
<h3>4.2.4 Physical space/Room technologies</h3>
<p>Although the number of hardware providers of high end video conferencing equipment 
	is relatively small and system configurations are limited, it is important 
	to carry out a needs and task analysis, (i.e. what is the purpose of the video 
	conferencing system in the organization and for what tasks will it be used) 
	and an environmental survey. These surveys are useful in determining the system 
	requirements, the human resources required to manage the system and an appropriate 
	room or room modifications that might be required. The results of these analyses 
	will have cost, management and timeline implications. For example, if lighting 
	renovations are required the project budget will increase.</p>
<a id="4.2.5" name="4.2.5"></a>
<h3>4.2.5 Environmental Considerations </h3>
<p>In order to have effective video communication, the hardware must be properly 
	configured and housed in an appropriate environment. There are numerous technical 
	guidelines published to assist organizations and individuals in proper environmental 
	assessments and setup for various configurations of video conferencing hardware 
	(see Polycom, 2004; McAteer, 2000; and Brightline, 2002 to name a few) but 
	few of these guidelines address the special considerations required to accommodate 
	people with special needs, particularly sign language users and remote interpreters.</p>
<a id="4.2.6" name="4.2.6"></a>
<h3>4.2.6 Future Considerations</h3>
<p>Some industry pundits (Lee, T., 200X) suggest that instant messaging and mobile 
	cell phone technologies will assist in the acceptance of personal video conferencing. 
	Already, cell phones incorporate instant messaging capability with image processing 
	and video capabilities. As the next generation enters the workforce they will 
	already be exposed and using instant messaging and video conferencing., &#8220;These 
	kids are ready for video conferencing because they were brought up in front 
	of cameras their whole life.&#8221; (Brandofino, M. Glowpoint Inc. page #.) 
</p>
<br />
<a id="4.3" name="4.3"></a>
<h2>4.3 Technology issues related to accessibility</h2>
<p>Video conferencing technology mostly involves audio and video communication 
	mediated through computing and network systems. There is some, although considerable 
	less, interaction with computer software required to carry out a video conference. 
	Accessibility by people with disabilities involves access to communication. 
	For people who have no communication disabilities, video conferencing remains 
	accessible. For example, for people who are blind or have low vision, the 
	video conference becomes an audio-only conference. All of the standard audio 
	conference issues such as, ensuring software applications are accessible to 
	screenreaders, and the need to have visual materials made available prior 
	to the conference and readable by a person who is blind are relevant here. 
	However, none of these issues is unique to video conferencing and guidelines 
	for inclusive audio conferencing, and access to images and other visual materials 
	are available from other sources. An example of web guidelines are the Web 
	Accessibility Guidelines of the W3C, (W3C, 2004). </p>
<p>For people who are keyboard users, there are also very few issues related to 
	video conferencing applications that are different from other software applications. 
	One unique issue is the accessibility of camera controls and pre-set buttons. 
	These controls are often available through a remote control or button panels 
	and/or software buttons. Remote control settings may need to loaded into specialized 
	assistive technologies such as an environmental control unit in order to this 
	person to access the camera controls. Where controls are provided through 
	software, keyboard access is required to allow use of these controls.</p>
<p>The people with the highest need for access solutions to video conferencing 
	then are people who are deaf or hard of hearing and who are non-speaking. 
	The remainder of this report will focus on access issues and guidelines to 
	ensure that there is access to audio and video communication for people who 
	are deaf or hard of hearing. </p>
<a id="4.3.1" name="4.3.1"></a>
<h3>4.3.1 Video conferencing and use with sign language interpreters for people 
	who are deaf.</h3>
<p>One exciting opportunity offered by video conferencing technology is that of 
	supporting people who are sign language users in accessing sign language interpreter 
	services; services that can be particularly difficult to obtain in geographically 
	remote locations. Sign language interpretation is required to mediate communication 
	between deaf and hearing people. When sign language users are in geographically 
	remote locations, it is now feasible for them to have access to interpreter 
	services using video mediated communication technologies. However, there are 
	important considerations and differences to address. In this section, we discuss 
	the unique issues that arise when remote interpretation is required and provide 
	amendments to technical and use guidelines to account for these special needs. 
	These recommendations are based on our experiences since 2003 using high-end 
	video conferencing for remote interpretation.</p>
<p>We will also provide a brief introduction to sign language interpretation and 
	video remote interpreting as a sub-specialty within sign language interpreting.</p>
<a id="4.3.1.1" name="4.3.1.1"></a>
<h4>4.3.1.1 Sign Language Interpretation</h4>
<p>Sign language interpretation is required when people who are deaf must interact 
	with people who are hearing such as in business meetings, for court, and for 
	accessing social and medical services. It is essential for providing equal 
	access to these activities and services for people who are deaf, and in many 
	western countries it is required through legislative initiatives (for example, 
	see the Americans with Disabilities Act, US Department of Justice, 2003). 
</p>
<p>American Sign Language (ASL) is the most prevalent sign language used in North 
	America although it is not the only one (e.g., in Quebec, Canada Langue des 
	Signes Qu&eacute;b&eacute;coise is used). ASL, like other sign languages, 
	is a visual-spatial language without much grammatical similarity to English 
	(Stokeo, 2001). It is considered a linguistically complete, natural language 
	system where the elements of the language are not equivalent to vowels and 
	consonants of written languages, and it is not a translation of English. Vocabulary 
	and meaning of concepts in ASL are expressed using a series of hand gestures, 
	facial gestures such as eyebrow motion and lip-mouth movements, and body movements 
	that change in time and space. This series of gestures cannot easily be represented 
	by a single written or spoken word. Fingerspelling is used to spell out a 
	word in alphabetic characters that has no sign. For example, there is no unique 
	sign for email and it is therefore represented as the hand gestures for an 
	&#8220;e&#8221;, an &#8220;m&#8221;, an &#8220;a&#8221;, an &#8220;i&#8221; 
	and an &#8220;l&#8221; separately. </p>
<p>In order for communication with hearing people to be effective in any situation, 
	the person who is deaf must be able to completely express herself, and must 
	also have complete access to the meeting and communication activities. Interpreters 
	are required to provide a translation of what is said as well as broker any 
	linguistic clarification required and cultural differences experienced between 
	the two parties (Avery, 2001). In face-to-face situations with inexperienced 
	participants, communication can be awkward and difficult. Common practices 
	of turn-taking, participation, maintaining a common understanding and access 
	are noticeably different from meetings that occur between all hearing participants 
	or all sign language participants. For example, common cues to indicate a 
	speaker is ready to relinquish the floor to another speaker are different 
	between hearing and sign language users. </p>
<p>Hearing people use a variety of verbal and non-verbal signals such as eye gaze, 
	asking a question of another person, and head turns to manage turn-taking 
	(Preece et al., 2002) in a group environment. All of these signals are very 
	subtle and learned and participants are generally unaware of when, where, 
	how and the speed with which such tactics are used. Sign language users tend 
	to use more obvious hand gestures such as pointing, and waving their hands 
	to gain attention and fewer non-verbal cues. </p>
<p>In an interpreted setting, the flow of communication tends to be slower due 
	to the translation process. In addition, the sign language user&#8217;s visual 
	attention is with the interpreter and not with others in the meeting. As such, 
	they cannot attend to subtle turn-taking gestures, such as shifts in eye gaze 
	employed by hearing individuals, in order to know that the speaking floor 
	is available. Turn-taking must therefore be slowed down and made more obvious 
	or formal so that sign language users have a chance to keep up and participate.</p>
<p>Other difficulties that arise in meetings between deaf and hearing participants 
	include difficulties maintaining a common level of understanding because of 
	the use of two different languages to discuss common subjects, and difficulties 
	with access to private or &#8220;whispered&#8221; conversations. These types 
	of difficulties are not that different from those experienced during meetings 
	between participants using two different spoken languages. However, the role 
	of the interpreter can be very different. The sign language interpreter often 
	must interject cultural and emotional interpretations, request clarification, 
	and interrupt the meeting flow to allow the deaf person a chance to speak. 
</p>
<p>The role of the meeting chair in these kinds of interpreted settings is very 
	important as management of the meeting is ultimately his responsibility. The 
	meeting chair must be aware of the differences and needs of all meeting participants 
	and take extra steps to ensure that all participants are included and involved.</p>

<h4>4.3.1.2 Video remote interpreting</h4>
<p>Video remote interpreting in general is identified by interpreting service 
	providers as an enhancement to the existing service and requires specialised 
	training and different terms of use. For example, the Association of International 
	Conference Interpreters suggests that spoken language remote interpreters 
	should only work for three hours per day and that video interpreting is significantly 
	more fatiguing over a 30-minute turn than conventional face-to-face interpreting 
	(Moser-Mercer, 2003). These restrictions and issues apply to sign language 
	video remote interpreters and will likely be amplified because of the physical 
	nature of sign languages.</p>
<p>Video remote interpreting is considered a specialization within the sign language 
	interpreting field. It is defined as the use of video conferencing technology 
	to provide interpreter services where a participant or the sign language interpreter 
	is located at a geographically different location. Many of the difficulties 
	evident in face-to-face meetings are amplified for video remote interpreting 
	and new ones arise that reflect the weaknesses of video conferencing in general. 
</p>
<p>There are numerous organizations throughout the world that provide video remote 
	interpreting services (My Video Interpreter, 2004; SignTalk, 2004; and Community 
	Access Network, 2004 are three examples) but there is no standardized training 
	protocol or guidelines to overcome some of the difficulties. In addition, 
	there are few best practice examples that demonstrate ways to use the strengths 
	of the technology and overcome some of the weaknesses.</p>
<a id="4.3.1.3" name="4.3.1.3"></a>
<h4>4.3.1.3 Challenges of Video Remote Interpreting </h4>
<p>Many challenges arise when video remote interpreting is employed. Some of these 
	challenges relate directly to the quality of the camera hardware and the bandwidth 
	of the video conferencing system. For example, remote interpreters must consciously 
	adjust their natural signing space to accommodate the camera&#8217;s field 
	of view. They cannot sign outside of the area captured by the camera. Many 
	high-end cameras have zoom controls that can adjust this field of view by 
	zooming the lens either wider or closer. However, a wider field of view that 
	shows more of an interpreter&#8217;s natural signing space also captures more 
	of the background and surrounding scenery that can be distracting for the 
	person who is deaf. Inexpensive webcams do not have an adjustable field of 
	view and sign language users often must move farther away from the camera 
	so that more of their signing space can be seen or they must restrict their 
	signing to the area around their faces.</p>
<p>Fingerspelling tends to be very fast-paced and not well articulated in face-to-face 
	situations. Only a very high bandwidth video conferencing system will not 
	become pixilated and be effective for fast fingerspelling. Fingerspelling 
	therefore must be slowed down and done closer to the interpreter&#8217;s body. 
	However, when fingerspelling slows down so does the rate of communication 
	between deaf and hearing interlocutors. There is thus a significant impact 
	on the potential for misunderstandings and for missed opportunities to turn 
	take.</p>
<p>One important aspect of hardware technologies that has a large impact on the 
	success of sign language use is the camera view angle or field of view. This 
	is defined as the viewable area or scene that can be seen through the camera 
	(Segal, 2004) and it is a function of the focal length of the camera lens. 
	For example, a wide angle lens with a short focal length has a very large 
	field of view or area of the scene that can be seen through the camera lens. 
	Zooming in the camera increases the focal length and decreases the field of 
	view to a much smaller area of the scene.</p>
<p>Remote interpreting removes the chance to develop rapport with consumers, and 
	for that reason has been met with some resistance on the part of sign language 
	interpreters.</p>
<a id="4.3.1.4" name="4.3.1.4"></a>
<h4>4.3.1.4 Considerations for video remote interpreting</h4>
<p>With video remote interpreting there can be three possible interpreter locations:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The interpreter is remote from both parties (hearing person and deaf person 
		physically located together);</li>
	<li>The interpreter is physically located with the person who is deaf and 
		the hearing participant(s) are remote; or </li>
	<li>The interpreter is physically located with the hearing participant(s) 
		and the person is deaf is remote. </li>
</ol>
<p> Each scenario requires unique considerations regarding the behaviour and perception 
	of the interpreter/deaf person pair. However, regardless of scenarios, one 
	aspect remains constant; the interpreter and deaf person must have constant 
	eye contact and must be able to see each other’s signs at all times. A breach 
	of eye contact indicates that communication has been severed. </p>
<p>Video conferencing technology is designed to support communication between 
	one or more remote users.</p>
<a id="eye" name="eye"></a>
<h5>Eye contact/gaze</h5>
	<p>Chen et al (2003) have suggested that eye contact is very important in communication 
	of any kind. They indicate that when a speaker is looking to the left, right 
	or upward, the recipient believes that the message is not meant for him. If 
	the eye gaze is slightly downward, although not preferable, the recipient 
	believes that the communication is intended for them. This could explain why 
	television newscasters read from a teleprompter that is positioned slightly 
	below the front view camera. Although the newscaster&#8217;s gaze is slightly 
	downward, viewers still believe that the newscaster is speaking directly to 
	them and that the message is meant for them. The same is true in video-mediated 
	communication. </p>
<p>Cameras are usually positioned above the main viewing screen (the screen that 
	shows the video images of the remote interlocutors) meaning that eye gaze 
	is slightly downward (people are looking at the viewing screen and not the 
	camera). However, large viewing screens or small field of view cameras create 
	a large gap between the camera and the positions of a person&#8217;s gaze 
	(while they are looking at the viewing screen). It appears that a person&#8217;s 
	gaze is significantly downwards (not slightly downwards) and can be very disconcerting 
	particularly if the interpreter is remote from the person who is deaf. When 
	the interpreter is remote the deaf person has no other connection or means 
	of communication with the interpreter other than through the video conferencing 
	system. Maintaining eye contact (even artificially) is crucial for deaf people 
	using video conferencing in this situation. </p>
<p>The interpreter can adjust their position to the camera by sitting far enough 
	back from the camera or zooming the camera out so as to appear to be having 
	eye contact with the person who is deaf. However, doing so also increases 
	the amount of background scenery that the person who is deaf must contend 
	with and screen out particularly with low level or even lighting conditions. 
	Spot lighting can be used to emphasize the interpreter and de-emphasize the 
	scenery but this must be carefully planned and orchestrated; something that 
	is not normally part of a video conference setup. </p>
<p>When the person who is deaf is physically located with the interpreter, maintaining 
	eye contact between the interpreter and the person who is deaf is relatively 
	straight forward. The interpreter can sit next to the video display so that 
	the person who is deaf is always looking toward the monitor. However, the 
	person who is deaf may still appear to the remote participants as though she 
	is looking in another direction and may be disregarded by the other interlocutors 
	because it seems as though she is not participating due to the mis-interpreted 
	eye gaze cue. In addition, the interpreter cannot see the remote participants 
	and may miss the non-verbal cues for turn-taking and other important meeting 
	activities. </p>
<p>In face-to-face situations, interpreters know that if they make eye contact 
	with the hearing speaker, the speaker assumes he is talking to the interpreter 
	and loses his connection with the deaf participant. It is an automatic human 
	behaviour that people tend to look at the person who is speaking (verbally) 
	and thus make eye contact. Experienced interpreters usually avoid eye contact 
	with the hearing person as a non-verbal reminder to that person that he should 
	direct his remarks to the deaf person. Remote interpreting can interfere with 
	this practice particularly when the person who is deaf is remote from the 
	interpreter (interpreter is physically present with the hearing participants 
	or remote to all participants). </p>
<p>When the interpreter is remote to all parties, the interpreter must look at 
	the viewing screen to watch the person who is deaf. To all parties this seems 
	as though the remote interpreter is now looking more directly at them and 
	the viewing screen (and hence the interpreter) becomes the centre of unwanted 
	focus. In addition, the opportunity for the interpreter to use eye gaze as 
	a non-verbal cue to indicate that hearing participants should relate to the 
	person who is deaf is considerably reduced. Careful attention to seating plans 
	is one way to alleviate some of these difficulties.</p>
<a id="seat" name="seat"></a>
<h5>Seating</h5>
	<p>In a video conferencing setting, seating should always be an important 
	consideration because the remote participant has considerably less presence 
	and prominence than those at the local site. For remote interpreting situations 
	much more thought must be given to the position of each participant, and whether 
	the interpreter is sitting or standing (community interpreters may be more 
	accustomed to standing while interpreting and thus may prefer to stand. However, 
	in general it is preferable for the interpreter to be seated). Having tools 
	such as notepads or laptops can also be useful for tracking what is being 
	said or presented. Table 2 shows the suggested seating arrangements for the 
	three different interpreter locations. Note for all situations, flowers, water 
	bottles, computer screens and other items generally located on tables should 
	be removed to reduce the visual clutter in the camera&#8217;s field of view.</p>

<a id="environ" name="environ"></a>
<h5>Environmental and technical issues</h5>
<p>There are environmental and technical solutions that can be optimised for people 
	using sign language. When identifying the location(s) for video conferencing, 
	considerations such as physical environment (e.g. room size, lighting, acoustics 
	room setup and furniture) and uses of video conferencing in that environment 
	are important to optimise and renovate if needed. Table 2 summarises some 
	of the important technology considerations when hearing and deaf people are 
	participating in a video conferencing together.</p>
<p>Technical or equipment solutions are also possible and in combination with 
	environmental adjustments can greatly assist in optimising a video conference 
	for people who are deaf and using interpretation. For example, video transmission 
	frame rate of greater than 15 frames per second is critical. Having consistent, 
	high quality image transmission rates available through dedicated high bandwidth 
	networks such as ISDN or high speed IP-based networks can provide this. </p>
<p>When using video conferencing with people who are deaf, audio is less important 
	(although it is still relatively important for the interpreter), and the need 
	for camera controls (remote and local) becomes more important. A personal 
	microphone such as a lavaliere or lapel microphone for the interpreter rather 
	than a high-end room microphone can be used. In the situation where the interpreter 
	is with the hearing participants a room microphone and a personal microphone 
	may be required. This also means that intelligent audio signal processing 
	(in the form of an intelligent hardware or software mixer) must be available 
	to switch between the various audio sources (e.g., interpreter voicing and 
	meeting participants). </p>

<p class="cap">Table 3: Summary of technology considerations for video conferences involved 
	hearing and deaf participants.</p>
<p>The environment must have minimal &#8220;visual noise&#8221; such as windows, 
	wall coverings, as any thing or person that moves that will distract users. 
	These types of visual distractions can disrupt the whole flow of communication 
	in a video communication session that includes people who are deaf. Camera 
	controls such as zoom can be used to adjust the image to eliminate some of 
	these distractions. However, adjusting the image may not be appropriate in 
	all situations (e.g., in a many-to-many conference where the remote participant 
	needs to see all of other participants). Cameras with controls tend to be 
	more expensive, high end cameras.</p>
<a id="visnoise" name="visnoise"></a>
<h5>Detailed Examples of Visual Noise</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Windows can cause significant visual noise. Outside activities seen through 
		the window can be distracting, and lighting from windows can cause difficulties 
		for cameras that automatically adjust for lighting conditions. Cameras 
		pointed at users sitting in front of windows will be flooded with background 
		light and the transmitted image of the user will appear only as a dark 
		object in front of a well-lit window.</li>
	<li> Window coverings such as curtains that sway, or those that do not completely 
		cover the window can be distracting. </li>
	<li>Objects typically found on tabletops during meetings, like water bottles, 
		and laptops can also contribute to visual noise. </li>
	<li>Tables with highly glossed surfaces cause light to reflect off the table 
		and into the camera. Cameras that automatically adjust brightness settings 
		will then adjust for the camera to accommodate this reflected light and 
		most other images in the surroundings, including the people will appear 
		dark.</li>
</ul>
<a id="physfactors" name="physfactors"></a>
<h5>Other physical factors to consider</h5>
<a id="" name=""></a>
<p><strong>Tables:</strong> Tables with a matte finish are recommended in order to reduce 
	additional glare. Depending on the size of the sessions, tables should be 
	portable (eg: wheels on legs, or detachable legs) to allow optimal set up. 
	A large meeting could be accommodated by a series of tables and technologies 
	set up as shown in <a href="asl.php.html#fig21">Figure 21</a>.</p>
<a id="" name=""></a>
<p><strong>Objects on Table:</strong> Minimize the amount of items visible on the table. 
	Flowers, water bottles, computers and other objects disrupt the field of vision 
	and should be placed elsewhere.</p>
<a id="" name=""></a>
<p><strong>Curtains:</strong> Solid curtains are recommended to allow the least amount of 
	visual distraction. Vertical shades, however, are not recommended, as they 
	allow sunlight into the room and cause difficulties for cameras with automatic 
	brightness compensation.</p>
<a id="" name=""></a>
<p><strong>Lights:</strong> Adequate room lighting ensures productive communication. The 
	most optimal lighting is one that illuminates the users face and hands directly. 
	However, this type of lighting is likely to cause discomfort to the user.<br>
	Also, bright overhead lighting minimizes shadows on the face and hands. Brightline 
	Inc. (Brightline, 2002) provides recommendations and shows optimal lighting 
	arrangements for video conferencing. Lighting and lighting placement are a 
	function of room size, person location, wall and ceiling reflectance. </p>
<a id="" name=""></a>
<p><strong>Chairs:</strong> The chairs should not be &#8220;squeaky&#8221; when rocked back 
	and forth. Casters on casters are most appropriate for tiled floors to prevent 
	scraping sounds when the chairs are moved. The ideal floor covering is carpet 
	with under padding to minimize the chair moving sounds.</p>
<a id="" name=""></a>
<p><strong>Room Colour:</strong> The walls in the video conferencing room should be painted 
	a solid neutral colour (blue and greens are also acceptable). Walls with patterns 
	or pictures are visually distracting.</p>
<a id="fig21" name="fig21"></a>
<p><img src="images/fig21.jpg" /></p>
<p class="cap">Figure 21: Different furniture and placement configurations.</p>
<a id="turn1" name="turn1"></a>
<h5>Turn-taking</h5>
	<p>Another critically important consideration is that of turn-taking. Because 
	of the difficulties in producing and understanding non-verbal cues during 
	any video conference, turn taking becomes much more cumbersome in general. 
	Interlocutors constantly miss turn-taking cues resulting in communication 
	errors such as overlapping each other or interrupting, having long moments 
	of silence, and taking control of the floor for lengthy periods of time. When 
	someone who is deaf is added to the video conference these difficulties and 
	errors become elevated. </p>
<p>It is often the role of the interpreter to mitigate turn-taking but it may 
	be a much more difficult task for a remote interpreter because they too may 
	miss the turn-taking cues. At the Canadian Hearing Society, attempts to solve 
	this particular difficulty involve employing a conference manager at one site. 
	This person is not the meeting chairperson and is only responsible for managing 
	all of the technology as well as maintaining a formal speaker&#8217;s list 
	(by monitoring people&#8217;s desire to speak). This approach is the most 
	successful approach to date but it not the most cost-effective method because 
	it requires another person to facilitate the meeting.</p>
<p>Fels et al. (2000) investigated the use of technology such as lights (flashing, 
	spinning, etc), and a waving hand as a way of improving turn-taking for video 
	conferencing. They found that having a waving hand mechanism activated by 
	a remote participant was very successful at gaining the attention of all participants. 
	While this may be appropriate for classroom settings or even meeting settings, 
	a waving hand may not be acceptable or appropriate in all situations. Further 
	study of this type of approach may provide acceptable solutions. </p>
<p>A third solution to this problem is to use an electronic token to request a 
	turn to speak. This is similar to a physical meeting token or formal speaker 
	list that is commonly used to formalize turn-taking in face-to-face meetings. 
	A user would request the token indicating that she wants a turn to speak, 
	have her turn and then release the token when finished. There must be an override 
	mechanism, perhaps controlled by the meeting chairperson, so that a person 
	does not take complete control of the meeting or the floor. The electronic 
	token can keep circulating until the communication session is complete. There 
	has been little research on the effectiveness of this approach to formalised 
	turn-taking and the acceptance by hearing and deaf people of such a method 
	for video conferenced meetings.</p>
<a id="confidential" name="confindential"></a>
<h5>Confidentiality</h5>
	<p>There are important and unique confidentiality and ownership issues arise 
	with video conferencing. For example, questions such as whether recording 
	a video conference violates confidentiality rules, who owns the archive, and 
	who can access the archive remain unanswered. Similar to audio recording practices, 
	permission to record the audio/visual proceedings should always be sought 
	from participants. This permission should address the ownership and access 
	issues. Legal advice is warranted if archiving video conferences is a normal 
	procedure for an organisation. </p>
<a id="multiconf" name="multiconf"></a>
<h5>Special Considerations for managing multipoint or multi-application conferencing</h5>
	<p>The user will have the opportunity to connect such equipment as a document 
	projector and/or a scan converter that allow people to present paper-based 
	visual materials through the video conferencing.</p>
<p>Video conferencing equipment such as Polycom allows the user to switch between 
	different presentation technologies while in session. For example, the user 
	can switch and allow the users at the remote locations to see a PowerPoint 
	presentation or videotape on the full screen while presenting. For the hearing 
	presenter/participant, there are no barriers as the hearing presenter can 
	continue to speak and the users can see the PowerPoint presentation simultaneously. 
	For deaf users deaf or hard of hearing users must read the PowerPoint presentation 
	first and then return to the presenter or the interpreter being on the screen. 
	This can cause disruptions (and hence delays) in the flow of the presentation 
	and requires considerable mental effort on the part of the deaf participant 
	who must then remember what was on the visual display. </p>
<p>The presenter should be aware of the difficulties of presenting additional 
	visual materials simultaneously with discussion and provide visual materials 
	to participants before the video conferencing or prepare the presentation 
	to account for participant&#8217;s needs to keep switching the view screen 
	between the visual material and the interpreter or speaker. For example, the 
	presenter should constantly repeat verbally points on visual material being 
	discussed or allow time for participants to take notes or copy the material 
	on the slides. </p>
<p>Displaying a PowerPoint presentation on the same image as the presenter is 
	worse because it can be very difficult for the users at the remote locations 
	to see the PowerPoint presentation (it is usually too small or the projection 
	screen in the local location is poorly lit).</p>
<a id="otherfactors1" name="otherfactors1"></a>
<h5>Other factors</h5>
	<p>The need to constantly monitor the auditory &#8220;goings-on&#8221; of the 
	physical environment and then decide what is important to communicate to the 
	person who is deaf is an important secondary task for the interpreter. For 
	example, an interpreter might ignore a pencil that falls on the ground because 
	it does not have any consequence for the communication transaction in a face-to-face 
	meeting. However, when the interpreter is remote the physical context is limited 
	by what can be viewed though the camera. It is difficult for the interpreter 
	to determine whether an unseen audio event such as a door shutting outside 
	the view of the camera is important or not. The interpreter must be hyper-vigilant 
	and constantly assess the importance of non-speech and unseen audio events 
	increasing the already high cognitive load and corresponding fatigue levels 
	for the interpreter. Frequent breaks (e.g., every 30 minutes) or more than 
	one interpreter may be required to accommodate these increased cognitive demands.</p>
<p>One final consideration for video conferencing situations is that they can 
	include multiple applications. Many video conferencing technologies allow 
	you to incorporate presentations (e.g. PowerPoint, videotapes (VCR, DVD), 
	a drawing application to share work among all participants and other visual 
	mediums) If only one viewing screen is available, the video conferencing software 
	allocates the viewing priority to the application. The hearing participants 
	can talk over the display and hear what is being said. However, in situations 
	where the interpreter is located with the hearing participants or remote from 
	all participants, the deaf person cannot participate because the interpreter&#8217;s 
	video is replaced by the application images. In this situation, the use of 
	two viewing screens, one dedicated to the interpreter and the second one for 
	other images is required, or the shared work must be paper-based. Users might 
	have the opportunity to connect such equipment as &#8220;Elmo&#8221; and or 
	a scan converter to allow user to use different technologies through the videoconferencing 
	to provide more visual information.</p>
<p>Videoconferencing equipment such as that available through Polycom allows the 
	user to switch between the mediums while a session is happening. For example, 
	the user can switch and allow the users at the remote locations to see a PowerPoint 
	presentation or videotape on the full screen while presenting. For the hearing 
	presenter, this results in no barriers as the hearing presenter can continue 
	to speak and the users can see the PowerPoint presentation. For the deaf users 
	it requires more time as the presenter must allow the deaf or hard of hearing 
	users to read the PowerPoint presentation and then go back to the presenter 
	or the interpreter being on the screen. Using a PowerPoint presentation with 
	the presenter through the videoconferencing camera results in less than optimal 
	viewing because it is very difficult for the users at the remote locations 
	to see the PowerPoint presentation. Ultimately the ideal setting would be 
	allowing sufficient viewing times between the mediums to allow the users to 
	read the content. Ideally it would be an excellent idea to send copies of 
	your presentation (e.g. PowerPoint) to the remote users and interpreters. 
	Table 3 summarises the most common behavioural, etiquette and communication 
	issues experienced by hearing and deaf people during video conference sessions.

<h4>4.3.1.5 Considerations for Remote Sign Language Interpreters </h4>
<a id="prep" name="prep"></a>
<h5>Preparation</h5>
	<p>An interpreter with many years of interpreting experience will be reasonably 
	comfortable in most interpreting settings. However, the addition of remote 
	interpreting makes every interpreting situation potentially new and anxiety 
	provoking. </p>
<p>Some of the concerns that interpreters will have include: </p>

<ol>
	<li>Interpreters want assurances that the people at the remote site will understand 
		their needs and be able to meet them.</li>
	<li> Whether remote interpreting equipment will be placed in the correct position. 
	</li>
	<li> Whether people at the remote site will be familiar with how to use an 
		interpreter and the particular dynamics of using a visual interpreter 
		remotely?</li> </ol> <p></p>
  
<p>To ease some of these concerns, remote interpreters require as much information 
	as possible prior to the interpreting event. Information about the participants, 
	the meeting purpose, agenda items for discussion, intended outcomes of the 
	assignment, and any presentation materials should be provided at least one 
	day ahead of the scheduled video conference. </p>
<a id="vidconf" name="vidconf"></a>
<h5>During the video conference</h5>
	<p>If deaf people are meeting an interpreter face-to-face for the first time, 
	they tend to ask personal questions such as whether the interpreter&#8217;s 
	parents are deaf, or where and why they learned sign language to establish 
	a rapport with the interpreter. A remote interpreter may not have this same 
	opportunity to interact with the deaf consumers before the interpreting session, 
	and may be unable to develop that important rapport with those deaf consumers. 
</p>
<p>In addition, there can be regional differences in sign language that may cause 
	communication difficulties or misunderstandings. For example, a Canadian deaf 
	person may be assigned an American remote interpreter who will use subtle 
	differences in sign language vocabulary. The may cause difficulties for the 
	deaf person in understanding what is being said or expressing herself clearly. 
	It is important to schedule introductory time between the remote interpreter 
	and a deaf consumer ahead of the meeting (at least 10 minutes) to allow these 
	individuals to establish some rapport, and acknowledge and accommodate for 
	regional differences. </p>
<p>The interpreter&#8217;s role is to facilitate communication between the hearing 
	and deaf participants. During the session, the interpreter might ask for the 
	participants to clarify what is being said because he/she did not hear the 
	content or under the meaning of the content being said.</p>

<a id="processing" name="processing"></a>
<h5>Processing in public</h5>
	<p>While the interpreter is voicing for the deaf consumer in a face-to-face situation, 
	it is assumed that the other participants are focused on the deaf speaker 
	and the hearing people are only listening to the interpreter. In a video conference 
	the remote interpreting may be the centre of attention because the remote 
	interpreter is seen on the viewing screen. The interpreter must perform the 
	complex cognitive task of interpreting while being in the unusual position 
	of being the centre of attention. This potentially adds discomfort and cognitive 
	load to the already considerable cognitive load from interpreting for a remote 
	sign language interpreter. </p>
<a id="lagtime" name="lagtime"></a>
<h5>Lag Time</h5>
	<p>During any interpreting assignment there is a lag, or delay, from the time 
	the source message from the deaf participant is presented, to when the interpreter 
	understands the message and presents it in the target language. This lag may 
	be longer when videoconferencing technology is used due to the delay introduced 
	by the technology. The ability of the deaf participant to participate on an 
	equal level is restricted. Participants need to know to expect these delays 
	and account for them meetings. <a href="video.php.html#3.4.1.6">Section 3.4.1.6</a> provides some suggested solutions 
	to assist in managing the turn-taking difficulties imposed by the increased 
	lag time. In addition, we suggest that a set of guidelines should be presented 
	to all participants before the conference begins in order to educate people 
	on the communication differences and the procedures put in place to accommodate 
	these differences. The meeting chair or the access manager should be responsible 
	for disseminating these guidelines.</p>
<a id="interpreters" name="interpreters"></a>
<h5>Interpreters, deaf people and hearing people at several sites </h5>
	<p>Where there are several deaf people and interpreters for one video conference, 
	the arrangement of cameras, viewing screens and seating becomes more complex. 
	If several deaf people are participating in a multi-point call, they may have 
	interpreters present with them at their site. In that case, the interpreter 
	at that site voices and the information is re-signed by the interpreter at 
	the other sites. The deaf people then have the choice of watching the deaf 
	participant directly, or watching the &#8220;shadowed&#8221; version provided 
	by the interpreter in person at their site. In a multi-point or continuous 
	presence call, the frame speed of each square is reduced enough so as to increase 
	the difficulty of the interpreting task. Having deaf people provide an interpreter 
	at their site reduces some of this difficulty.</p>
<a id="interrupt" name="interrupt"></a>
<h5>Interrupting the speaker (either deaf or hearing)</h5>
	<p>In person, there are opportunities for the interpreter and the deaf consumer 
	to exchange brief signs that reinforce the accuracy of parts of the interpretation. 
	For example, if a deaf person was talking about their family, an interpreter 
	might check briefly, &#8220;Do you have FOUR brothers?&#8221; The deaf person 
	could communicate the answer to the interpreter without necessarily stopping 
	the natural flow of the communication. This checking of the accuracy of the 
	initial interpretation might not be obvious to the audience listening to the 
	voice interpretation. When interpreting remotely, it can be difficult for 
	the interpreter to &#8220;check in&#8221; with the deaf consumer and interrupting 
	becomes more complicated. The interpreter needs regular access to the consumers 
	and the meeting chairperson so she can easily stop the proceedings in order 
	to get clarification when needed. However, even if this occurs, the subtle 
	accuracy &#8220;checking&#8221; becomes more conspicuous to the other participants 
	and may cause disruption. </p>
<p>Preparation materials provided to the interpreter ahead of time can significantly 
	offset this need for interrupting the speaker. As long as the interpreter 
	has the proper background materials ahead of time, the need for interrupting 
	the flow of the communication can be minimized. </p>
<a id="reduce" name="reduce"></a>
<h5>Reduced Signing Space</h5>
	<p>An additional challenge to remote interpreters is they must adjust their natural 
	signing space to accommodate the field of view of the camera. They cannot 
	sign outside of a prescribed area that falls within the camera&#8217;s visual 
	field otherwise the deaf participant cannot see what is being said. Reducing 
	the natural signing space can cause additional cognitive load and fatigue 
	for the interpreter. More frequent breaks or team interpreting may be required 
	to relieve this additional strain on the interpreter. </p>
<a id="audref" name="audref"></a>
<h5>Auditory Referencing</h5>
	<p>Interpreters who are at the same location as their deaf and hearing consumers 
	have the luxury of looking at exactly what is being referenced in the communication. 
	Interpreters cannot sign the spatial relationship if they cannot see what 
	is being referenced. For example, if a speaker says, &#8220;You put this over 
	here,&#8221; the interpreter will be at a loss as to how to describe what 
	is being discussed. It is more effective for deaf and hearing participants 
	to be explicit in what they are referencing such as, &#8220;Your name goes 
	in the blue box in the right-hand corner of the first page.&#8221; </p>
<a id="team" name="team"></a>
<h5>Team Interpreting</h5>
	<p>Team interpreting is difficult to successfully carry out remotely without 
	audio headsets that allow the interpreters to communicate together without 
	disrupting the rest of the viewing audience. It is hard for the interpreters 
	to confer on best linguistic choices (either for sign language or English) 
	without individual headsets and microphones. If one of the team interpreters 
	is at a remote setting, their audio is transmitted as soon as they offer linguistic 
	suggestion. It is likely to be perceived as an auditory or visual distraction 
	to the other participants. </p>
<a id="deaf" name="deaf"></a>
<h5>Deaf Interpreter</h5>
	<p>The Certified Deaf Interpreter (CDI) is an individual who is deaf or hard 
	of hearing. In addition to proficient communication skill and general interpreter 
	training, the CDI has specialized training and/or experience in the use of 
	gesture, mime, props, drawings and other tools to enhance communication. The 
	CDI has knowledge and understanding of deafness, the Deaf community, and Deaf 
	culture. The CDI possesses native or near-native fluency in American Sign 
	Language (Registry of Deaf Interpreters, 2004).</p>
<p>There are some unique considerations for video remote interpretations that 
	are applicable to Deaf interpreters. These include:</p>
<ol type="a">
	<li>Negotiate with consumer(s) to create working conditions that will facilitate 
		the most accurate and comfortable delivery of interpreting services</li>
	<li>Inform consumers (hearing and deaf) of any problems the video conferencing 
		session and make efforts to correct them. In this situation, the deaf 
		interpreter may require more time to facilitate communication between 
		the deaf person and the sign language interpreter. Depending on the communication 
		needs of the consumer, the amount of time needed for effective communication 
		may actually double.</li>
	<li>Communicate with team member(s), particularly at the beginning of the 
		video conference, to assess effectiveness of the interpreting. </li>
	<li>At the completion of the assignment, it is critical that the deaf interpreter 
		inform the consumers (hearing and deaf) about the clarity of the assignment.</li>
</ol>
<a id="4.3.1.6" name="4.3.1.6"></a>
<h4>4.3.1.6 Skills Needed for Remote Interpreters</h4>
<p>There are very few documents describing specific interpreter skills required 
	for successful remote interpreting. However, where there is mention of remote 
	interpreting, there is agreement that remote interpreters must have considerable 
	experience as face-to-face interpreters. Novices or new graduates of interpreter 
	training programs may find remote interpreting extremely difficult. The types 
	of skills that are learned through experience that are particularly transferable 
	to remote interpreting are:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Closure skills &#8211; Interpreters must have the vocabulary, in English 
		and in Sign Language, to appropriately complete sentences. An example 
		of this might be a deaf person telling a story about going to an office 
		to drop off their resume and having to leave it with a receptionist. The 
		interpreter might miss the actual fingerspelling of the word &#8220;r-e-c-e-p-t-i-o-n-i-s-t&#8221; 
		due to the time lag or pixelation caused by the video conferencing system 
		but can still use their interpolation and closure skills to make a meaningful 
		sentence. </li>
	<li>Assertiveness &#8211; The remote interpreter must be willing to interrupt 
		proceedings that are preventing participation by the deaf person for whatever 
		reason, particularly if the chairperson is unable to manage the turn-taking 
		and time lag issues. However, this is an added task for the interpreter 
		and is not ideal. The interpreter may want to have a discussion with the 
		chair person regarding some of the issues and solutions to turn-taking 
		and accommodating the time delay to ensure equal access by the deaf person. 
		Better yet, the interpreter can carry a set of guidelines such as the 
		ones included in this document to provide to inexperienced meeting chairs.</li>
	<li>Memory &#8211; The interpreter must track new, incoming information as 
		well as the gist of what has just been interpreted. This is required because 
		there are often ambiguous references made to previous utterance (such 
		as to a previous PowerPoint slide that is no longer on screen) or location 
		indicators such as &#8220;I put that document over here&#8221;. In addition, 
		remote interpreting tends to have more communication mis-understandings 
		than face-to-face interpreting so the interpreter must have an idea of 
		where the communication breakdown may have occurred, and where to go back 
		to amend or correct the interpretation.</li>
	<li>Lexical choices &#8211;The interpreter must have several lexical choices 
		for the same concept, as some signs will be more conducive to a 2-dimensional 
		medium than others. Experienced interpreters will have gained sufficient 
		alternative expressions to accommodate and made lexical adjustments to 
		accommodate this situation.</li>
	<li>Varied Experiences &#8211; Interpreters with various kinds of community 
		interpreting experiences will have the ability to interpret for a wide 
		variety of consumers (both deaf and hearing). This is particularly important 
		for remote interpreting because the likelihood of interpreting for people 
		outside of the interpreters&#8217; regular community is high. For example, 
		an interpreter from Canada may be interpreting remotely for someone in 
		the southern US.</li>
</ol>
<a id="otherfactors2" name="otherfactors2"></a>
<h5>Other factors to consider</h5>
<ol>
	<li>The optimal background colour is a solid blue or black.</li>
	<li>The interpreter&#8217;s attire needs to be a solid blue or black colour 
		as well.</li>
	<li>Excessive movement is sometimes difficult for the camera to capture. It 
		is best if the interpreter stays in one place. </li>
	<li>A highly skilled interpreter is preferable, but he should be able to adjust 
		his signing rate to account for less optimal camera frame rates.</li>
	<li>The interpreter should arrive at least 15 minutes prior to the meeting. 
		If it is an interpreter&#8217;s first exposure to video conferencing (after 
		training), it is recommended that the interpreter arrive at least 30 minutes 
		early. The deaf person should also arrive 15 minutes prior to the meeting.</li>
</ol>

<a id="4.4" name="4.4"></a>
<h2>4.4 Illustrative cases and personal accounts highlighting issues</h2>
<p>This section provides a short description of several cases and personal accounts 
	illustrating the common issues using video conferencing for people with disabilities. 
	Emphasis on experiences of deaf consumers is made due to the complications 
	of language translation and the importance of high quality video. </p>
<p>The first case is of a family with a hearing father and deaf mother gathered 
	to discuss parenting strategies with the hearing staff of a child protection 
	agency in order to determine whether the child could stay in the home. The 
	interpreter was connected remotely through a video conferencing system and 
	all other participants were face-to-face. There were no remote camera controls 
	so that the interpreter could not control the camera in the meeting room. 
</p>
<p>The mother was very upset and crying. As a result, she could not pay attention 
	to the viewing screen, and the interpreter had difficulties gaining the attention 
	of the other meeting members to assert the mother&#8217;s needs. Also, the 
	staff was seated with their backs to the viewing screen and facing the father, 
	so that they could not see the interpreter&#8217;s attempts to gain their 
	attention. The interpreter was trying to accurately and intelligently represent 
	the mother&#8217;s communication but because the mother was so upset there 
	was considerable delay in processing the mother&#8217;s communication. This 
	only added to the delay imposed by the technology. In addition, the hearing 
	people continued to give new information and talk while the mother was trying 
	to communicate and the interpreter was trying to interpret that communication 
	and intervene on behalf of the mother. While having to process language as 
	well as assert the deaf person&#8217;s needs are normal responsibilities of 
	the interpreter, the seating arrangement, the lack of support for and recognition 
	of the mother in the physical setting, the lack of turn-taking structures 
	and the lack of acknowledgement of the interpreter&#8217;s importance resulted 
	in a failed meeting. Many of these difficulties arose because the interpreter 
	was remote and had difficulty gaining attention and recognition.</p>
<p>While this was a difficult situation even for a face-to-face meeting, the situation 
	was exacerbated by the difficulties resulting from the remote video interpretation 
	issues. To overcome some of these difficulties, there are a number of possible 
	solutions. A formal attention-getting mechanism such as a flashing light with 
	audio would have likely aided in allowing the interpreter and deaf mother 
	to have more presence in the meeting. The hearing staff needed to be seated 
	in such a way as to see the interpreter&#8217;s eye gaze and turn-taking indicators. 
	In addition, the staff did not have much experience with video conferencing 
	technology, and did inadvertent things such as placing coffee cups down near 
	the microphone causing audio spikes that were very disconcerting for the interpreter. 
	Camera controls or properly setup camera view angles that suited the needs 
	of the interpreter were required. An access manager would have greatly assisted 
	in helping facilitate appropriate setup and use of the technology, and remove 
	some of the barriers to successful communication.</p>
<p>The next three cases are first-person accounts from three individuals directly 
	involved in providing video conferencing services at CHS; two are remote video 
	interpreters, and one is a technical support person at CHS.</p>

<h3>4.4.1 Personal Account: My First Impressions of Videoconferencing<br>
	By Video Remote Interpreter 1 </h3>
<p>Question: <strong>What was your first impression of video conferencing? As a consumer?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <i>&#8220;The first time I ever interpreted remotely, the deaf 
	consumer copied everything I was signing as if he was watching a teleprompter. 
	How many times does your television ever talk to you? It&#8217;s a difficult 
	concept for people to get their heads around. Those consumers whom I had met 
	before seemed to pick up the concept faster. If the deaf consumer has never 
	met the interpreter they may not know that the person signing to them on the 
	television screen is actually expecting a response; that the process is interactive.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What were your first experiences as a remote video interpreter?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <i>&#8220;Sign Language Interpreters work hard at improving 
	their English and Sign Language skills and be recognized as competent professionals. 
	To impose technology that makes the interpretation feel more difficult and 
	stilted feels like a step backward. Will people know that I&#8217;m not &#8220;new&#8221;? 
	Will they see me as an interpreter with experience? As a &#8220;seasoned interpreter,&#8221; 
	why should I put myself in a position to feel inadequate when they are many 
	easier assignments readily available?&#8221;</i></p>
<h3>4.4.2 Personal Account: My First Impressions of Videoconferencing<br>
	By Video Remote Interpreter 2</h3>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> <i>What was your first impression of video conferencing? As 
	a consumer?</i></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <i>&#8220;The first experience I ever had using videoconferencing 
	was two years ago for a job interview. I knew two of the people at the far 
	site, but I was convinced they were angry with me. The camera had zoomed out 
	in order to fit the three far-site people in the picture at the same time. 
	I couldn&#8217;t see their facial expressions very well and I felt as if my 
	personality was really coming across like a lead balloon. Although it was 
	a very clear connection (384 kbps and 30 fps) there was a slight delay in 
	the amount of time it took for them to understand my questions and respond. 
	The experience made me think that I might not want a job doing a lot of videoconferencing 
	if this is what is was all about. I figured it wasn&#8217;t much different 
	(or better) than a teleconference call. I had a person with me that ran the 
	remote control, but he wanted to leave for another commitment. I was terrified 
	at the prospect of being left alone with the equipment (particularly in a 
	job interview where you want to appear competent at what you&#8217;re doing).&#8221;</i></p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What were your first experiences of remote video interpreting? 
	Difficulties experienced?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <i>&#8220;My first experience interpreting by video conference 
	was for a deaf consumer that I have known both personally and professionally 
	for many years. I thought this would make it easier, but in fact it &#8220;upped 
	the ante&#8221; and made me more fearful of making a mistake. I thought if 
	I made a mistake, people would question my interpreting skills and think, 
	&#8220;Boy, we thought she&#8217;d do a great job with Susan seeing that they&#8217;ve 
	known each other for years!&#8221; It provided an extra pressure on top of 
	the already difficult interpreting task. The situation was further complicated 
	by well-intentioned individuals (who knew sign language) who noticed me struggling 
	and yelled out either background context that I was missing, or yelled out 
	the fingerspelling that I had missed, in order to help me. I had to get the 
	deaf person to fingerspell very slowly and to change the orientation of some 
	of the signs she was producing. Although the deaf person was quite willing 
	to accommodate my needs, I felt like I was giving her an extra task to do. 
	She was already concentrating on her thoughts, and then had to remember my 
	needs. Interpreters are used to blending into the background so that the deaf 
	person and hearing person communicate directly with each other. Having to 
	interrupt either the hearing person or the deaf person more often made me 
	feel more conspicuous in the interpreting event than I was accustomed to being.&#8221;</i></p>

<h3>4.4.3 Personal Account: Web Applications Specialist </h3>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What was your first impression of video conferencing? As a 
	consumer?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <i>&#8220;IT&#8217;S ABOUT TIME! Back in 1991 I was very interested 
	in videoconferencing and how we can use this to communicate visually. The 
	equipment back then was using six telephone lines to communicate and the setting 
	up of this was complex. We now have come to modern day videoconferencing using 
	IP or IDSN. The quality of the visual information has gone up considerably, 
	but there is still room for improvement. </i></p>
<p><i>It a new way of communicating and requires new set of rules. The complexity 
	of providing meetings with various communication needs is a challenge. I find 
	myself in a group of deaf individuals who sign only is fine and the only problem 
	is getting people&#8217;s attention at the other location. Often we forget 
	the person at the other end. There needs to be a way electronically or through 
	human interactions to improve &#8220;attention getting&#8221; cues in this 
	medium.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What were your first experiences of providing video conferencing 
	services at CHS? </p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <i>&#8220;Given the implementation of IP videoconferencing at 
	The Canadian Hearing Society, it has provided us new ways of providing services. 
	We have many deaf, deafened and hard of hearing people in the north who does 
	not have access to a sign language interpreter. By providing the interpreter 
	through videoconferencing, it&#8217;s breaking down the barrier and at the 
	same time saving costs. I know of individuals in Timmins who are in need of 
	interpreters and we can provide this service from Toronto through videoconferencing. 
	Literacy classes, sign language classes and counseling are other kinds of 
	events that are taking place via videoconferencing. With the videoconferencing, 
	we are breaking down the geographical barriers and being able to provide information 
	in a visual medium.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>These three accounts provide some insight (need for training, pre-conference 
	planning, technology improvements, ways to improve and acknowledge presence 
	of remote person and but that the geographical a significant barriers that 
	can be mediated by vc).</p>

<h2>4.5 User Environment Scenarios:</h2>
<p>In an effort to better understand and elucidate the issues inherent in different 
	uses of video communication technologies, the following section will examine 
	three key user group environments: health, education, and business, and common 
	tasks used in these environments. For each user group environment, the challenges 
	and issues connected with its unique requirements will be explored, and possible 
	remedies will also be presented. </p>
<p>The scenarios discussed mainly involve one-to-one and small groups. Even though 
	there are many different scenarios and combinations, our recommendations will 
	be based on the most popular scenarios that are commonly presented on daily 
	basis when video remote interpreting is used.</p>
<a id="4.5.1" name="4.5.1"></a>
<h3>4.5.1 Health care Environments </h3>
<p>Health care environment tend to involve limited sets of personnel with limited 
	tasks to be achieved. However, it is very important that people have equal 
	access to the health care environment and are able to successfully communicate. 
	Telemedicine is becoming a much more common approach for providing access 
	to medical services, particularly specialist services, for people in remote 
	communities. It is important to consider the needs of people with disabilities.</p>
<a id="4.5.1.1" name="4.5.1.1"></a>
<h4>4.5.1.1 Tasks</h4>
<p>Common tasks that video conference participants may want to carry out in this 
	setting are:<br>
	<br>
	Consultation &#8211; question and answer session regarding particular health 
	needs or issues.<br>
	Examination &#8211; inspection of physical, or mental state of patient.<br>
	Prescription &#8211; discussion of a particular course of treatment, intervention 
	or action.</p>
<a id="4.5.1.2" name="4.5.1.2"></a>
<h4>4.5.1.2 Physical scenarios </h4>
<p>A deaf patient would like to consult with medical personnel (e.g., a doctor, 
	nurse, psychiatrists, or medical technician) through an interpreter via video 
	conferencing. The following list includes possible scenarios of remote interpreter/deaf 
	consumer combination.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The interpreter is in a remote location and patient and doctor, hospital 
		staff or health-care providers at the local location.</li>
	<li>The interpreter is with the deaf person and the doctor, hospital staff 
		or health-care providers are remote.</li>
	<li>Interpreter can be at one location, deaf person at another and doctor, 
		hospital staff or health-care providers at yet another location.</li>
</ul>
<a id="4.5.1.3" name="4.5.1.3"></a>
<h4>4.5.1.3 Issues unique to health care settings</h4>
<a id="physpos" name="physpos"></a>
<h5>Physical Positioning</h5>
	<p>The National Council on Interpreting in Health Care (NCIHC) has produced guidelines 
	for the role of verbal language interpreters working face-to-face in health 
	care settings. In these settings, they recommend that interpreters be positioned 
	near the patient&#8217;s head with their backs to the patient giving the patient 
	as much privacy as possible. However, sign language interpreters must always 
	have eye contact with the patient for communication to be understood so they 
	must stand in such a place as to see the patient&#8217;s facial expressions. 
	NCIHC also recommends that interpreters stand between the patient and health 
	care provider so as to appear as unbiased participants.</p>
<p>A sign language interpreter working remotely cannot be guaranteed that busy 
	health care providers in emergency settings will understand the interpreters&#8217; 
	positioning preferences or be able to accommodate them at a bedside with limited 
	room to maneuver the required medical equipment. </p>
<a id="sign" name="sign"></a>
<h5>Sign language production</h5>
	<p>The ill deaf person lying in bed will not have the same clear sign language 
	production as that of the interpreter, nor will they necessarily maintain 
	a small enough signing space to fit within the camera&#8217;s field of view. 
	This can be particularly problematic when the interpreter is remote from the 
	deaf person.</p>
<p>One recommendation is to use technical solutions such as zooming out the camera 
	lens to capture their whole signing space and environment. However, the interpreter 
	risks losing critical facial expressions that are achieved by having the camera 
	closer to the deaf person&#8217;s face. There can be a constant conflict between 
	wanted to see a larger view of the room, and the need to go close to the deaf 
	person to see nuances in the facial expression.</p>
<a id="socpol" name="socpol"></a>
<h5>Socio/Political</h5>
	<p>When remote video interpretation is the method of service delivery, deaf participants 
	may mistrust the interpreter because they have no working relationship with 
	the interpreter and no common cultural context. They may withhold some of 
	their communication. This may also work to the benefit of the deaf person. 
	In a sensitive health care setting, deaf people may say more because they 
	do not know the interpreter personally and chances are will not run into that 
	same interpreter out in the community.</p>
<p>Socio/political factors emerge as some of the most important factors for successful 
	video conferencing and remote interpreting. Failure to account for these factors 
	can result in a failed conference and service to the deaf person. These factors 
	include psychological aspects such as an interpreter&#8217;s ability to cope 
	with the stress of a remote interpreting assignment, or a deaf person&#8217;s 
	ability to cope with the stress of having medical needs and the confidence 
	to express these needs via a video conferencing system and/or remote interpreter; 
	having to rely on a screen to derive the visual support information necessary 
	for carrying out the interpreting task; motivation; processing information 
	from multiple sources; social isolation; and operating multiple controls while 
	effectively communicating. For example, in personal statements it has been 
	reported by interpreters and deaf people that the lack of proximity between 
	a deaf person and her interpreter can create a feeling of alienation that 
	may results in lack of motivation, a decrease in interpreting quality, and 
	a decrease in the deaf person&#8217;s involvement and participation in the 
	video conference.</p>
<p>The deaf person may be at significant disadvantage because of these socio/political 
	factors. In addition, they may feel intimidated by a lack of medical knowledge 
	and and by not having a physical presence at the consultation, meeting or 
	evaluation. This may result in an unbalanced power relationship between medical 
	personnel and the deaf patient that can, in turn, cause withdrawl by the deaf 
	participant, the need for the interpreter to take on a strong advocacy role, 
	and errors made by the medical team by unconfirmed or incorrect assumptions. 
	Awareness, experience and perhaps a patient advocate who is physically present 
	with the medical team may be ways in which some of these difficulties can 
	be mediated.</p>
<a id="4.5.1.4" name="4.5.1.4"></a>
<h4>4.5.1.4 Guidelines and Protocols specific to Health Scenarios</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Follow general guidelines listed in <a href="video.php.html">Section 3.0</a>.</li>
	<li>It is recommended that a system with &#8220;picture-in-picture&#8221; 
		capabilities be used and that deaf consumers and interpreters be instructed 
		to monitor themselves in the &quot;Picture in Picture&quot; screen to 
		ensure that their signing stays within the camera's view. Individuals 
		may need to adjust their signing space to accommodate small camera field 
		of views.</li>
	<li>The deaf consumer at the remote end should have access to the camera controls 
		so that they can ensure that the signs being transmitted by the interpreter. 
		One important consideration is that the deaf person must also have training 
		and a comfort level with the technology in order to manage camera controls, 
		sign adequately and communicate his/her needs in an environment where 
		the deaf person may be feeling sick or enjoy little power in the relationship.</li>
	<li>Video conferencing calls should be recorded for future reference or for 
		legal needs.</li>
	<li>There can be a general need for a mobile video conferencing facility if 
		people do not have the mobility to move to a &#8220;special video conferencing 
		room&#8221;. The recommendations in this document would apply to this 
		type of portable system as well.</li>
	<li>A pre-conference meeting (using the video conferencing system) is recommended 
		to alleviate some of the cultural and technical difficulties that might 
		interfere with the success of the actual conference, and to provide new 
		users with some practice. </li>
	<li>The technology should be tested and adjusted prior to the meeting to ensure 
		that connection numbers, cameras, microphones and displays are working 
		correctly. This also avoids time being spent on audio and video checks 
		during the meeting.</li>
	<li>The interpreter should always remain in direct eye contact with the person 
		who is deaf regardless of the position of equipment or other people. </li>
	<li>Be cognizant of the psychological stress imposed by medical situations 
		and increased potential for the deaf participant to be alienated due to 
		a reduced ability to communicate while ill and over a video conferencing 
		system. It may be too easy for the medical practitioners to inadvertently 
		ignore the deaf person&#8217;s needs.</li>
</ul>
<a id="4.5.2" name="4.5.2"></a>
<h3>4.5.2 Education Environments </h3>
<p>Distance learning has become more popular and gained wider acceptance as an 
	effective instructional tool (Gowan &amp; Downs, 1994; Benford et. al., 1998).<br>
	Students of all types have begun to take advantage of this services institution 
	are offering. Video mediated communication is a valuable educational resource 
	because it provides access to live instructors or teaching assistants; it 
	can be more motivating than students working on their own, and can help students 
	improve communication skills (Knight, 1998).</p>
<p>When a deaf student is registered at a post-secondary institution, whether 
	it is through distance learning or face-to-face classes, she is often provided 
	with an interpreter. As interpreting services can be difficult to obtain particularly 
	for students at institutions in more remote locations (e.g., University of 
	the Cariboo in northern British Columbia), the possibility of using remote 
	interpretation is very real. Interpretation would be provided by interpreters 
	in major centres that can often be quite a distance from the student. </p>
<a id="4.5.2.1" name="4.5.2.1"></a>
<h4>4.5.2.1 Typical tasks</h4>
<p>Common tasks that students (remote or local) may want to carry out in this 
	setting are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Listening/pay attention to instructor for extended periods of time (e.g., 
		one hour).</li>
	<li>Interacting with instructor with question/answer or discussion styles 
		of interaction. </li>
	<li>Interacting with peers in formal group meetings, or in side conversations.</li>
	<li>Interrupting instructor to ask question.</li>
	<li>Formal presentation of academic material or point of view for entire class.</li>
	<li>Viewing class material (e.g., PowerPoint presentations, overheads, videos, 
		music, blackboard/whiteboard markings, and images, websites, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<a id="4.5.2.2" name="4.5.2.2"></a>
<h4>4.5.2.2 Physical scenarios</h4>
<p>There are a number of possible physical scenarios in which video conferencing 
	is used to serve deaf students. These apply whether the video conferencing 
	is used in a distanced education or a face-to-face teaching situation.</p>
<p>In the first scenario, the deaf student and her interpreter are in the same 
	location. The interpreter would be signing the material being delivered by 
	the instructor and voicing questions from the deaf student. This scenario 
	is the most straight-forward as the interpreter can remain outside of the 
	field of view of the camera and the viewing screen in the classroom only shows 
	the deaf student. The image in the student&#8217;s location shows the instructor 
	and/or the classroom depending on the controls provided with the video conferencing 
	system. <br>
	A second scenario is where the interpreter and instructor are in the same 
	location and the deaf student is in the remote location. The interpreter is 
	video remote interpreting the material being taught by the instructor while 
	having a physical presence in the classroom. While the deaf student will always 
	appear on the viewing screen, the interpreter potentially will have a stronger 
	presence in the classroom particularly when voicing the deaf student&#8217;s 
	communication. Maintaining focus on the deaf student is a difficult task for 
	the interpreter particularly when there are many other people in the classroom. 
	The viewing screen is often located at the front of the classroom for the 
	simple reason of access to electrical power. The deaf student is not an integrated 
	part of the class but rather stands out at the front and may believe that 
	everyone is always &#8220;watching&#8221; him. In addition, the eye gaze position 
	of the deaf student due to the camera location may seem as though the deaf 
	student is otherwise occupied or not paying attention. This may cause the 
	student to take a passive stance and not participate in discussions or queries. 
</p>
<p>PEBBLES (Weiss &amp; Fels, 2001) is one example of a video conferencing system 
	that allows a remote student to be placed anywhere in a classroom. It is a 
	video conferencing robot designed to allow students in hospital to attend 
	school. Remote students have control over what they can view in their classroom 
	and what others can see of them. Studies with PEBBLES (Fels, 2003) indicate 
	that students using PEBBLES become integrated into the classroom quickly and 
	that they do not receive more attention than other students after an initial 
	novelty period. Placing the video conferencing unit at a normal &#8220;seat&#8221; 
	in the classroom may remove some of the unwanted focus on the deaf student 
	at the front of the class. </p>
<p>The third scenario would occur when the deaf student is physically attending 
	a course in a classroom and the interpreter is remote. The video conferencing 
	system would be setup in the classroom and transmit a live image and voice 
	of the interpreter (the interpreter would sign what the instructor was saying 
	and voice comments, questions, discussion points signed by the student).</p>
<p>Similar to the second scenario, the video conferencing system would usually 
	be placed at the front of the classroom and potentially become the focus of 
	attention particularly when the interpreter is voicing the deaf student&#8217;s 
	comments. The interpreter would have very little influence over where people 
	are looking as the interpreter&#8217;s eye gaze would seem to be towards all 
	people in the classroom. Using a personal video conferencing system in the 
	classroom that can be located close to the deaf student may potentially alleviate 
	some of these problems including focusing the attention on the deaf student 
	when he wants the floor.</p>
<a id="4.5.2.3" name="4.5.2.3"></a>
<h4>4.5.2.3 Issues unique to education settings</h4>
<a id="turn2" name="turn2"></a>
<h5>Turn-taking</h5>
	<p>In classroom situations, turn-taking tends to be more formalized where students 
	are expected to raise their hands to indicate they want the floor. Integrating 
	a turn-taking indicator such as a hand or an audible light may be an appropriate 
	method for the deaf student to also indicate she wants the floor. However, 
	using only a light or flashing light has been shown to be ineffective in classroom 
	settings (Weiss et al, 2001).</p>
<a id="shared" name="shared"></a>
<h5>Shared applications</h5>
	<p>Where PowerPoint presentations or other applications must be shared, dual 
	monitors must be used to ensure that the interpreter can always be seen by 
	the deaf student. If captioning is available for audio material such as videos 
	and films that have sound or music, it should be activated to ease some of 
	the burden on the interpreter. If no captions are available for video or music 
	material, the education delivery unit should consider producing them. This 
	is important for live access to this material during use for the class but 
	it is also important to allow students access to the material after class 
	when an interpreter is not available. </p>
<a id="otherfactors3" name="otherfactors3"></a>
<h5>Other important factors</h5>
	<p>Finally, constant attention to a video screen is fatiguing for deaf students 
	as they rely exclusively on their visual system to acquire communication messages. 
	Hearing students can take small visual breaks by using their auditory system 
	during class. More frequent formal breaks, at least once per hour, are required 
	to allow the deaf student to rest.</p>
<a id="4.5.2.4" name="4.5.2.4"></a>
<h4>4.5.2.4 Guidelines and Recommendations specific to education</h4>
<ul>
	<li> Follow general guidelines for listed in <a href="video.php.html">Section 3.0</a></li>
	<li> It is recommended that a system with &#8220;picture-in-picture&#8221; 
		capabilities be used and that deaf consumers and interpreters be instructed 
		to monitor themselves in the &quot;Picture in Picture&quot; screen to 
		ensure that their signing stays within the camera's view. Individuals 
		may need to adjust their signing space to accommodate small camera field 
		of views.</li>
	<li>The deaf consumer at the remote end should have access to the camera controls 
		so that they can ensure that the signs being transmitted by the interpreter. 
		One important consideration is that the deaf person must also have training 
		and a comfort level with the technology in order to manage camera controls, 
		sign and communicate adequately.</li>
	<li>As the instructor usually is responsible for managing class activities, 
		pre-conference training is highly recommended. The instructor must be 
		made aware of the unique communication and turn-taking needs of the deaf 
		person/interpreter pair, and given strategies for ensuring that these 
		needs are met.</li>
	<li>The technology should be tested and adjusted prior to the first class 
		to ensure that connection numbers, cameras, microphones and displays are 
		working correctly. This also avoids time being spent on audio and video 
		checks during the class and possible missed information from the instructor.</li>
	<li>The interpreter should always remain in direct eye contact with the person 
		who is deaf regardless of the position of the instructor, other people 
		or equipment in the classroom. </li>
	<li>Employ a formal turn-taking mechanism such as a remote hand that allows 
		the deaf person to overtly gain the attention of the instructor or class 
		peers.</li>
	<li>All class materials should be available to the deaf person and the instructor 
		before the class begins. </li>
	<li>Any video or music material used in class should be captioned, and the 
		captions turned on during viewing of the material in class.</li>
</ul>
<a id="4.5.3" name="4.5.3"></a>
<h3>4.5.3 Business Environments </h3>
<p>One of the most common applications of video conferencing with deaf participants 
	is a business meeting. These can take several forms including one-on-one, 
	small groups of less than fifteen individuals, and large meeting with many 
	people (e.g., annual general meeting). In each setting, there are unique issues 
	that must be addressed so that the deaf person can enjoy equal participation 
	and the interpreter is optimally positioned to facilitate this participation. 
</p>
<a id="4.5.3.1" name="4.5.3.1"></a>
<h4>4.5.3.1 Tasks </h4>
<p>Common tasks that video conference participants may want to carry out in this 
	setting are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Participate in the discussion, contributing comments and listening to 
		what others contribute. This can be accomplished using formal, agenda-driven 
		rules for turn-taking and meeting progress (e.g., Robert&#8217;s rules 
		of order) or much more informal processes where people raise hands to 
		request the floor or use non-verbal cues to take a turn when the opportunity 
		arises. Large group meetings tend to be much more formal with set agendas 
		and speakers, formal question/answer or discussion periods and formal 
		turn-taking structures.</li>
	<li>Proposing or seconding motions.</li>
	<li>Presenting information or materials where participant has formal and exclusive 
		control of the floor.</li>
	<li>Asking/answering questions/gaining attention</li>
	<li>Chairing meeting</li>
</ul>
<a id="4.5.3.2" name="4.5.3.2"></a>
<h4>4.5.3.2 Scenarios</h4>
<p>The following three scenarios of deaf/interpreter pairs are possible </p>
<a id="121meet" name="121meet"></a>
<h5>One to One Meetings</h5>
<ul>
	<li>The deaf person and the interpreter are in the remote location and the 
		hearing person is at the local location or vice-versa.</li>
	<li>The deaf person and the hearing person are in the local location while 
		the interpreter is at the remote location.</li>
</ul>
<a id="smallmeet" name="smallmeet"></a>
<h5>Small Group Meeting</h5>
<ul>
	<li>The group of deaf people and interpreter are at the local location while 
		the hearing person/people are at the remote location.</li>
	<li>The deaf person is at the remote location and the hearing people and interpreter 
		is at the local location.</li>
	<li>Deaf and hearing people at local location and the interpreter is at remote 
		location.</li>
</ul>
<a id="lrgmeet" name="lrgmeet"></a>
<h5>Large meetings</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Group of deaf and hearing people are at the local location while the interpreter 
		is at the remote location.</li>
	<li>Group of deaf and hearing people as well as the interpreter is at the 
		local location while at the remote location there would be a small group 
		of hearing and/or deaf people.</li>
</ul>
<a id="4.5.3.3" name="4.5.3.3"></a>
<h4>4.5.3.3 Issues unique to meeting settings</h4>
<a id="turn3" name="turn3"></a>
<h5>Turn-taking</h5>
	<p>Turn-taking issues are likely the more important issue to consider in meeting 
	with deaf people. Equal participation in video conferenced meetings often 
	involves equal access and particular sensitivity to turn-taking issues. Many 
	of the issues discussed in <a href="video.php.html">Section 3.1.4.6</a> apply in business meeting scenarios. 
</p>
<p>It is very important that turn-taking mechanisms be explicitly addressed and 
	formalised in meetings with deaf participants to ensure that people are not 
	isolated from discussions and can contribute equally. This is the responsibility 
	of the meeting chair and remote interpreter (and/or the access manager) even 
	when technological solutions are provided (e.g., a turn-taking indicator is 
	used).</p>
<a id="vismaterials" name="vismaterials"></a>
<h5>Visual materials</h5>
	<p>Business meetings like education scenarios often involve the use of visual 
	presentation materials. As discussed in section <a href="geospatial.php.html#5.2.3.2">5.2.3.2</a> and <a href="video.php.html#3.1.4.8">3.1.4.8</a>, there 
	are particular difficulties in using visual materials and speaking about those 
	materials simultaneously. Large group meetings are often planned well in advance 
	of the meeting. Providing visual materials to participants ahead of the meeting 
	is the usual practice. One-on-one meetings often do not involve the use of 
	other visual materials. </p>
<p>Small group meetings are often most affected by use of ad hoc or undistributed 
	visual materials. In order to best manage the needs of deaf users for access 
	to the visual materials and the interpreter through a single view screen, 
	the following suggestions are made:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Use a fax, internet connection or file transfer capabilities on the video 
		conferencing system to supply the deaf participant and the interpreter 
		with visual materials during the meeting. The meeting may need to pause 
		while this is carried out but can it can then resume at a faster pace 
		once all people have access to the visual materials.</li>
	<li>For a pre-planned meeting, the meeting organizer should request visual 
		materials be made available prior to the meeting or suggest that they 
		not be used.</li>
	<li>The presenter should repeat/read each point verbally before discussing 
		it as well as explicitly announce when a page/slide should be turned to 
		the next one. This will be useful for blind and deaf participants.</li>
</ol>
<a id="socpol2" name="socpol2"></a>
<h5>Socio/political</h5>
	<p>The social/political issues that arise with for the health care environment 
	are also potential issues in business meetings. <a href="geospatial.php.html#5.1.3.3">Section 5.1.3.3</a> under Socio/political 
	health provides details of those issues.</p>
<a id="techalt" name="techalt"></a>
<h5>Technology alternatives</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Desktop computer videoconferencing equipment can be used for one to one 
		videoconferencing.</li>
	<li>Small groups require boardroom style set up utilizing videoconferencing 
		equipment that allows camera movement via the remote control.</li>
	<li>Small groups require boardroom style set up utilizing videoconferencing 
		equipment that allows camera movement via the remote control.</li>
</ul>
<a id="4.5.3.4" name="4.5.3.4"></a>
<h4>4.5.3.4 Guidelines and Recommendations specific to meetings</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Deaf consumers and interpreters need to watch themselves in the &quot;My 
		Video&quot; or &quot;Picture in Picture&quot; screen to be sure that they 
		are signing within the camera's view. Deaf people might have to sign in 
		a smaller space than they normally do, so they are not signing off screen.</li>
	<li>The deaf consumer at the other end should have the control to zoom in/out, 
		up/down to be able to get the signs being transmitted by the interpreter.</li>
	<li>For large and small group meetings, a meeting chair should be assigned. 
		The chair is responsible for ensuring that participants with disabilities 
		and interpreters are explicitly included and meeting procedures address 
		their specific access needs. Planning this prior to the meeting ensures 
		that there are no meeting delays because these issues have not been addressed.</li>
	<li>It is ideal to have a separate access manager from the meeting chair who 
		is responsible for the operation of the technology and for ensuring that 
		access needs are met.</li>
	<li>Video conferencing calls should be recorded and archived for future references 
		and as video/audio notes. Confidentiality issues should be taken into 
		account.</li>
	<li>Visual materials should be made available to deaf participants and interpreters 
		at least one day prior to the meeting.</li>
	<li>Turn-taking procedures should follow formal turn-taking rules. The meeting 
		chair must be responsible for the management of turn-taking.</li>
	<li>Training sessions for video conferencing should include training and suggestions 
		to address access issues. </li>
</ul>
<br />
<a id="4.6" name="4.6"></a>
<h2>4.6 Live Captioning: An Overview</h2>
<p>Real-time or live captioning is a technique that is not currently available 
	in video conferencing technologies and that could provide many benefits to 
	users with disabilities. Real-time captioning involves the translation of 
	dialog or spoken information into text as it is occurring similar using court 
	stenographic procedures (court stenographer and technology). A verbatim text 
	transcript is provided to conference participants as participant dialog is 
	being produced. Not only does this allow participation by hard of hearing 
	participants and some deaf participants who use spoken language, but also 
	it allows a complete text archive of the meeting to be produced while the 
	meeting is in progress. The text stream could be displayed along with the 
	camera images on the view screen or it could be displayed over parallel technologies 
	such as through a website. <br>
	Services already exist that provide real-time captioning through remote connections. 
	The real-time captionist does not need to physically attend the meeting or 
	class but can use a remote audio/video connection to &#8220;listen&#8221; 
	to the meeting, and produce and display the real-time captions for meeting 
	participants.</p>
<p>Some of the difficulties with real-time captioning relate to accuracy levels 
	(or error rates during to typing inaccuracies, poor audio fidelity, and mis-hearing 
	words), interpreter&#8217;s ability to physically and cognitively cope with 
	speed of conversation, interpreter fatigue, and ways to easily provide emotive 
	or speaker identification information. Many of these difficulties remain unresolved 
	and additional research and development is required to address them. </p>

<h2>4.7 Recommendations and Guidelines &#8211; Summary</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Recommended minimum bandwidth is 384kbps for a typical business quality 
		videoconference.</li>
	<li> Good quality videoconference requires 30 frames per second video transmission.</li>
	<li>Data rate higher than or equal to 384 kbps will support a video screen 
		update of 30 frames per second, equal to VCR playback quality television. 
	</li>
	<li>Data rate lower than 384 kbps will support video screen update of 15 frames 
		per second or less, which is usable, but can seem jerky under rapid motion.</li>
	<li>Video transmission frame rate greater than 15 frames per second is critical.</li>
	<li>Audio is less important (it is still important for the interpreter), than 
		video, so need for camera controls (remote and local) is very critical.</li>
	<li>Personal microphone such as a lavaliere or lapel microphone for the interpreter 
		rather than a high-end room microphone can be used.</li>
	<li>If interpreter is with the hearing participants, a room microphone and 
		a personal microphone may be required.</li>
	<li>Intelligent audio signal processing (in the form of intelligent hardware 
		or software mixer) must be available to switch between the various audio 
		sources (e.g., interpreter voicing and meeting participants). </li>
	<li>Microphone should be placed next to interpreter voicing for deaf person.</li>
	<li>Remote interpreters should only work for three hours per day, since video 
		interpreting is more fatiguing than face-to-face interpreting.</li>
	<li>Maintaining eye contact is crucial for deaf people in video conferencing. 
	</li>
	<li>Sitting back from the viewing screen (approximately 244 cm or 8&#8217; 
		from a 32&#8221; monitor) simulates the most natural eye contact.</li>
	<li>Interpreter should position herself on camera by sitting far enough back 
		or by zooming out to appear to have eye contact with the deaf person .</li>
	<li>The interpreter should always remain in direct eye contact with the person 
		who is deaf regardless of the position of equipment or other people. </li>
	<li>Interpreters should avoid eye contact with a hearing person as a non-verbal 
		reminder that he should direct his remarks to the deaf person.</li>
	<li>If interpreter is remote to all parties, he must view screen to watch 
		the person who is deaf.</li>
	<li>To eliminate &#8220;visual clutter&#8221; in the camera&#8217;s field 
		of view, minimize visible items on the table such as flowers, water bottles, 
		computer screens, </li>
	<li>Table 1 suggests appropriate seating arrangements for all participants.</li>
	<li>An office divider in a neutral colour makes an appropriate backdrop.</li>
	<li>Walls in the video conferencing room should be painted a solid neutral 
		colour (blue and green are also acceptable).</li>
	<li>The environment must have minimal &#8220;visual noise&#8221; such as windows, 
		wall coverings, logos, murals or any thing or person that can distract 
		users.</li>
	<li>The optimal background colour is a solid blue or black.</li>
	<li> The interpreter&#8217;s attire needs to be a solid blue or black colour 
		as well and should contrast with the skin colour.</li>
	<li>Excessive movement is sometimes difficult for the camera to capture. It 
		is best if the interpreter stays in one place. </li>
	<li>Tables with a matte finish are recommended to reduce additional glare.</li>
	<li>Depending on the size of the sessions, tables should be portable (eg: 
		wheels on legs, or detachable legs) to allow optimal set up.</li>
	<li>Curtains are recommended to allow the least amount of visual distraction.</li>
	<li>Chairs should not be &#8220;squeaky&#8221; when rocked back and forth. 
		Casters on casters are most appropriate for tiled floors to prevent scraping 
		sounds when the chairs are moved. The ideal floor covering is carpet with 
		under padding to minimize the chair moving sounds.</li>
	<li> Adequate room lighting ensures productive communication. Optimal lighting 
		should illuminate the user&#8217;s face and hands directly and minimizes 
		shadows on face and hands.</li>
	<li>The interpreter must be hyper-vigilant and constantly assess the importance 
		of non-speech and unseen audio events</li>
	<li>If a presentation is incorporated in video conferencing one viewing screen 
		should be for the interpreter and a second one for the other images.</li>
	<li>Chairperson must ensure that all participants are included equally. </li>
	<li>When interpreters and deaf people are using PowerPoint in video conferencing, 
		there must be a pause between each slide and then interpreter can resume 
		watching the signing. Communication will not be accessible if the hearing 
		person continues to talk over the PowerPoint.</li>
	<li>If deaf participants announce themselves before signing; it will make 
		their participation in the meeting more equal to their hearing counterparts.</li>
	<li>Information about participants, meeting purpose, agenda for discussion, 
		intended outcomes of assignment, and any other materials should be provided 
		at least one day ahead of the scheduled video conference. </li>
	<li>Scheduled introductory time between remote interpreter and deaf consumer 
		ahead of the meeting (at least 10 minutes) is needed to allow these individuals 
		to establish rapport, and acknowledge and accommodate for regional differences. 
	</li>
	<li>Arrival of interpreter should be at least 15 minutes prior to the meeting, 
		but if it&#8217;s a first time it should be _ hour earlier. The client 
		(deaf person) should arrive 15 minutes prior to the meeting as well.</li>
	<li> A set of guidelines should be presented to all participants before the 
		conference to educate them on the communication differences and the procedures 
		of video remote interpreting.</li>
	<li> The interpreter requires regular access to consumers and meeting chairperson 
		to easily stop the proceedings to get clarification if needed.</li>
	<li>Remote interpreters should be experienced face-to-face interpreters.</li>
	<li>Interpreters must have the vocabulary, in English and in Sign Language, 
		to appropriately complete sentences.</li>
	<li>Remote interpreter must be willing to interrupt proceedings that are preventing 
		participation by deaf person for any reason, particularly if the chairperson 
		is unable to manage the turn-taking and time lag issues.</li>
	<li>Interpreters must track incoming information as well as the gist of what 
		has just been interpreted.</li>
	<li>The interpreter must have several lexical choices for the same concept, 
		as some signs will be more conducive to a 2-dimensional medium.</li>
	<li>Interpreters with diverse community interpreting experiences will have 
		the ability to interpret for a wide variety of consumers (both deaf and 
		hearing).</li>
	<li>The interpreter should be able to accommodate signing slower.</li>
	<li>To process language as well as assert the deaf person&#8217;s needs are 
		normal responsibilities of the interpreter</li>
	<li>System with &#8220;picture-in-picture&#8221; capabilities should be used 
		and deaf consumers and interpreters be instructed to monitor themselves 
		on the &quot;picture-in-picture&quot; screen to ensure their signing is 
		within camera's view. </li>
	<li>The deaf consumer at the remote end should have access to the camera controls 
		to better view the signs being transmitted by the interpreter. </li>
	<li> Consider a general need for a mobile video conferencing facility if people 
		do not have the mobility to move to a &#8220;special video conferencing 
		room&#8221;. </li>
	<li>A pre-conference meeting (using video conferencing system) can ease cultural 
		and technical difficulties that might interfere with actual conference, 
		and provide new users with practice. </li>
	<li>The technology should be tested and adjusted prior to meeting to ensure 
		connection numbers, cameras, microphones and displays are in order. This 
		also avoids time spent on audio and video checks during meeting.</li>
	<li>Medical situations can impose Psychological stress and increase potential 
		for deaf participant to be alienated due to a reduced ability to communicate 
		while ill and over a video conferencing system. The medical practitioners 
		may inadvertently ignore the deaf person&#8217;s needs.</li>
	<li>Interpreters should stand between the patient and health care provider 
		to appear as unbiased participants. </li>
	<li>Pre-conference training is highly recommended for a classroom instructor 
		and he must be made aware of the unique communication and turn-taking 
		needs of the deaf person/interpreter pair, and given strategies for ensuring 
		that these needs are met.</li>
	<li>Employ a formal turn-taking mechanism such as a remote hand that allows 
		deaf person to overtly gain attention of the instructor or class peers.</li>
	<li>All class materials should be available to the deaf person and the instructor 
		before the class begins. </li>
	<li>Any video or music material used in class should be captioned, and the 
		captions turned on during viewing of the material in class.</li>
	<li>Desktop computer videoconferencing equipment can be used for one to one 
		videoconferencing.</li>
	<li> Small groups require boardroom style set up utilizing videoconferencing 
		equipment that allows camera movement via the remote control.</li>
	<li>The deaf consumer at the other end should have the ability to zoom in/out, 
		up/down to get the signs being transmitted by the interpreter.</li>
	<li>Video conferencing calls can be recorded for any future legal issues as 
		well as being able to go through notes in case he/she feels that they 
		have missed something.</li>
	<li>Instructors are required to allow deaf student to rest at least once a 
		hour.</li>
	<li>A traveling &#8220;Road Show&#8221; that would show the videoconferencing 
		equipment to deaf individuals and explain its impact on service delivery. 
		Deaf people in remote areas will not know that it is possible for the 
		television to communicate with them. More education and exposure to this 
		technology will encourage cultural acceptance. </li>
	<li>Agencies that do a lot of remote interpreting should invest in &#8220;studio 
		quality&#8221; resources: the proper videoconferencing furniture, backdrop 
		colours and lighting.</li>
	<li>A separate certification process for remote video interpreters should 
		be investigated so that deaf and hearing consumers will have faith in 
		the professionals providing service to them in this medium.</li>
	<li>Headsets, laptops should be considered natural parts of the remote interpreting 
		process and should have resources designated to that purpose only.</li>
