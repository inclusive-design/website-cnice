<a id="overview" name="overview"></a>
<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>From December 2002 to March 31, 2004, the CNICE project brought together 12 
  organizations (representing a range of stakeholders and centres of expertise), 
  a large number of informal collaborators and an advisory panel of prominent 
  consumers, advocates and experts to address the inclusion of people with disabilities 
  in the Canadian cultural exchange (as audience, participants and artists). When 
  we first embarked upon this initiative we did not imagine the complexity and 
  scope of this undertaking. We have since discovered that we have opened a Pandora&#8217;s 
  box of challenges and opportunities. We have even identified a new art form. 
  We have uncovered as many questions as we have resolved problems. The discourse 
  and the products of this discourse were far richer, broad ranging and creative 
  than we initially conceived.</p>
  
<p>Apart from the large number of tangible products, CNICE produced a network 
  of collaborative partners who have benefited from the diverse perspectives, 
  wide range of skills and creativity of the partnership. This productive network 
  will persist and expand well beyond the end of the project. We have also reaffirmed 
  that by making our cultural exchange accessible to people with disabilities 
  we make it more inviting and accessible to everyone.</p>

<h1>The Outcomes</h1>

<p>The following describes the outcomes or deliverables of the CNICE project. The 
  guideline documents referenced are appended to this report. The software tools 
  are included in the accompanying CDs. The online environments and model content 
  are referenced through a Web address. All of the outcomes or deliverables described 
  can also be accessed through the Web site: <a href="index.html">http://cnice.utoronto.ca</a>. The outcomes 
  are divided into the following categories.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Guidelines and Companion documents</li>
	<li>Tools for modal translation</li>
	<li>Tools for Accessible Online Collaboration </li>
	<li>Model Content or Learning Material</li>
	<li>Meaning Equivalence Research</li>
	<li>Implementation and Evaluation</li>
</ol>

<a id="1" name="1"></a>
<h2>1. Guidelines and Companion Documents</h2>

<p>The purpose of the guideline documents is to describe techniques by which online 
  cultural material may be made more accessible to people with sensory, motor 
  and learning disabilities. The guideline documents include a single &#8220;core&#8221; 
  document followed by four &#8220;companion documents,&#8221; each devoted to 
  closer examination of particular areas:</p>
  
<ul>
	<li>Online Enhanced Captioning</li>
	<li>Online Video Description</li>
	<li>Remote Real-time ASL Interpretation, and</li>
	<li>Representations of Visual Geo-spatial Information.</li>
</ul>

<p>The core document, <em>General Guidelines for Inclusive New Media Cultural Content</em>, 
  is organized into seven main sections:</p>
  
<p><a href="http://cnice.idrc.ocadu.ca/generalguide.php#1.1">Section 1.1</a> is the introduction to the core document and outlines its scope. 
  This section also includes definition of terms used in the document as well 
  as a brief discussion of disability culture.</p>
  
<p><a href="http://cnice.idrc.ocadu.ca/generalguide.php#1.2">Section 1.2</a> is an overview of existing accessibility principles, of which, 
  developers of cultural content should be aware.</p>

<p><a href="http://cnice.idrc.ocadu.ca/generalguide.php#1.3">Section 1.3</a> lays out a number of challenges faced by developers of accessible 
  online cultural content. These include a discussion about the right to artistic 
  expression and accessibility, as well discussions of the aesthetics, entertainment 
  value, perspective and interpretation of cultural works as related to accessibility.</p>

<p><a href="http://cnice.idrc.ocadu.ca/generalguide.php#1.4">Section 1.4</a> introduces the concept of modality translations. Aspects of the 
  translation of art are discussed such as emotion, perspectives, presentation, 
  cultural differences and workflow. </p>

<p><a href="http://cnice.idrc.ocadu.ca/generalguide.php#1.5">Sections 1.5</a> and <a href="http://cnice.idrc.ocadu.ca/generalguide.php#1.6">1.6</a> detail the possible modality transformations and begin 
  the discussion of how translation of cultural content from one modality to another 
  might be carried out.</p>

<p><a href="http://cnice.idrc.ocadu.ca/generalguide.php#1.7">Section 1.7</a> is the conclusion of the core document.</p>

<p>The four companion documents follow in the next four chapters. The first companion 
  document, <a href="http://cnice.idrc.ocadu.ca/caption.php">chapter 2</a>, looks at online captioning and details captioning in Flash 
  as well as introduces the <em>CapScribe</em> tool for caption and video description that 
  was developed as part of the CNICE project. </p>

<p><a href="http://cnice.idrc.ocadu.ca/video.php">Chapter 3</a> details Online video description. This discussion extends a discussion 
  that is started in chapter 2 and provides guidance and principles for this modality 
  translation.</p>

<p><a href="http://cnice.idrc.ocadu.ca/asl.php">Chapter 4</a> studies in great detail the challenge of creating remote real-time 
  ASL interpretations for cultural events. Along with comprehensive guidelines, 
  the chapter provides first-hand viewpoints and an overview of relevant technologies. 
</p>

<p>The final companion document, <a href="http://cnice.idrc.ocadu.ca/geospatial.php">chapter 5</a>, discusses the special case of representing 
  visual geospatial information in alternative modalities. The authors discuss 
  solutions that use SVG as well as VRML. The authors close with guidelines for 
  creating inclusive navigation and way-finding content for the web. </p>

<p>While the guideline documents represent contributions, input and feedback from 
  a broad range of stakeholder groups, it was felt by the partners that further 
  input would be beneficial: to encourage broad buy-in and to insure that no relevant 
  perspectives were excluded. Consequently the guideline documents will be posted 
  on the site as a &#8220;public draft&#8221; and an online forum will be used 
  to solicit further input and feedback. </p>

<p>The documents will be broadly disseminated to cultural content producers in 
  all sectors (including the government), policy makers and developers of online 
  tools and environments. </p>

<h2>2. Tools for Modal Translation</h2>

<a id="capscribe" name="capscribe"></a>
<h3>The CapScribe Tool</h3>

<p>CapScribe is a tool for creating online captions that supports the use of rich 
  media for captioning as well as an easy method to generate descriptions. The 
  tool combines captioning and descriptions so that new media developers will 
  have access to a single tool to do both.</p>

<p>Currently the features include:

<ul>
  	<li>A flexible text editor for adding captions with a variety of text styles.</li>
	<li>A second caption track that can be used for second language translation 
		  or annotation.</li>
	<li>A second video track for providing sign language interpretation.</li>
  	<li>A graphics track for providing iconic representations and symbols.</li>
  	<li>An audio track and online recording environment for adding video descriptions.</li>
  	<li>A way to hyperlink captions to various page pages.</li>
  	<li>A method of defining caption and description locations which is fast 
  		and easy to implement.</li>
  	<li>A layout and preview screen for easy positioning of different media 
  		&#8220;regions&#8221; on the fly.</li>
  	<li>Output to SMIL or Quicktime formats for web or desktop deployment.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><img src="guidelines/images/fig16.gif" /></p>

<p>The following example is the main screen of the editor. It's set to the Caption option</p>
 
<p><img src="guidelines/images/capscribe1.gif" /></p>

<p>The Describe feature provides an easy method for creating video descriptions from the transcript stage to the recording stage.</p>

<p><img src="guidelines/images/capscribe2.gif" /></p>

<p>The Image feature provides lets authors quickly add graphics and as well, organize graphics and icons thematically.</p>

<p><img src="guidelines/images/capscribe3.gif" /> </p>

<p>The Layout and Preview window lets the author arrange and change the properties 
  of a variety of media.</p>

<p>Initial feedback has been positive. The CapScribe editor prototype will be 
  made available for public use shortly after the conclusion of the CNICE project. 
  As the prototype is still evolving, updates will be posted on the CNICE site.</p>

<a id="flash" name="flash"></a>  
<h3>Flash Captioning Tool</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.cnice.idrc.ocadu.ca/deliverables/flashcap/cctool.zip">http://www.cnice.utoronto.ca/deliverables/flashcap/cctool.zip</a><br />
  Many web developers and designers are moving toward using flash as a video development 
  tool. Flash enables online video to maintain a high quality without making excessive 
  bandwidth demands. For users who are deaf, however, the audio track of a flash 
  video is not accessible unless there is an accompanying caption track. To date, 
  no captioning tool was available for this video format. The Flash Captioning 
  Tool developed for the CNICE project enables developers to control the captioning 
  environment and determine the placement, font size, colour, etc of the captions, 
  while at the same time not sacrificing user control.</p>
  
<p>Available through the CNICE site as a free download, the target audience for 
  the Flash Captioning Tool ranges from professional web developers entrusted 
  with encoding video for use on broadcaster websites, to amateur designers and 
  developers looking to caption their flash based home videos.</p>
  
<p>Deaf Planet (<a href="http://deafplanet.com">http://deafplanet.com</a>) highlights the quality of the captioning 
  made possible by the Flash Captioning Tool. Developed to accompany the TVO television 
  series Deaf Planet, this web site features numerous videos in which the primary 
  language of interaction is American Sign Language. The videos on the web site 
  have all been captioned using the Flash Captioning Tool, and they illustrate 
  a broad range of color and font combinations currently unavailable within broadcast 
  captioning environments. The Flash Caption Tool&#8217;s broader palette of colors 
  styles, positions and backgrounds can be manipulated to match the aesthetic 
  of the video and/or web site. The Flash Captioning Tool also allows designers 
  to use the broader range of style options to convey paralingual information 
  contained within the audio track (things like the speakers tone of voice, background 
  noises or music) by creatively styling the text and background colors of the 
  captions.</p>

<p>While the Flash Captioning Tool is mainly used to add captions to flash based 
  video, extensions to the tool that could allow the inclusion of hyperlinks within 
  captions, multiple caption tracks to run simultaneously, and extend user control 
  over the appearance of the captions are within reach, and could be pursued should 
  future funding be identified.</p>
  
<p>As it stands currently, the Flash Captioning Tool dramatically increases the 
  possibility of adding captions to flash based video for both professional and 
  nonprofessional captioners and web developers. It is an accessible low-cost 
  captioning solution that is easy to use, flexible and can be easily integrated 
  within a flash video development process. With designers and developers increasingly 
  moving toward using flash as an online video platform, it is imperative that 
  technologies capable of producing captions for the format be widely available. 
  The Flash Captioning Tool meets this need.</p>
<a id="livescribe" name="livescribe"></a>
<h3>LiveScribe</h3>
  
<p>LiveDescribe has been designed to allow near real-time video description for 
  broadcast or web content. This process requires a different approach to video 
  description than the conventional processes because a describer will not have 
  time to prepare a script or even preview much of the material ahead of time. 
  New tools are required to facilitate this type of video description that involves 
  detection and presentation of non-dialog, low volume occurrences in the sound 
  track and to allow the description to extend beyond the limits of those occurrences. 
  Extending the limits must be under describer control and have minimal effect 
  on the video presentation.</p>
  
<p>The LiveDescribe! system thus performs two main functions: </p>

	<blockquote>
	1) notifies the describer of upcoming silent or low volume occurrences and 
	of the length of time of those occurrences in the video. These occurrences offer 
	an opportunity for inserting a description in real time. In LiveDescribe! silent 
	or low volume occurrences are presented as a series of blocks (indicated in 
	blue) on a white timeline that plays along with the video material (see <a href="finalreport.php.html#fig1.jpg">Figure 
	1</a>).<br /><br />
	<a id="collaboration" name="collaboration"></a>
	<a id="fig1" name="fig1"></a>
	<p><img src="guidelines/images/fig17.jpg" alt="Figure 1: Silence indicators that move horizontally as the video progresses" /> </p>
	<p class="cap">Figure 1: Silence indicators that move horizontally as the video progresses</p>

  	2) automatically pauses the video (extending its running length) to accommodate 
	  descriptions that exceed the available silence period. To accommodate descriptions 
	  longer than the detected silent periods, the system pauses the broadcasted video 
	  so that the describer can finish her/his description. Professional video describers 
	  have noted the importance of this feature to provide further and richer descriptions. 
	  It also allows describers to be less accurate with the timing of the description 
	  and the silence periods, particularly important when there is little or no planning 
	  process as in the live description situation. However, video extension cannot 
	  be implemented when video is constrained by external time demands such as with 
	  television programs.</p>
	</blockquote>
 
<p>We predict that the task of describing live will impose a high cognitive demand 
  on the video describer. The video describer must attend to two important main 
  activities: 1) the occurrence and length of silence or low volume, non-dialog 
  periods indicated by the silence period indicator; and 2) the content that must 
  be described. The describer must decide what is important to describe, determine 
  the best or most appropriate aspects of a scene to describe, and then insert 
  the description. All of these tasks must be accomplished as the video content 
  is playing. Describers may have only a few seconds to a few minutes of dialog 
  time to prepare for describing in the silence periods. Research must be carried 
  out to determine how many silence periods can be used and at what frequency 
  they can occur before the describer cannot cope or makes too many errors. </p>

<p>System ease of use is critical in supporting these describer activities because 
  of the high cognitive load imposed by the two main describing activities. We 
  want to minimize any additional cognitive load imposed by the system&#8217;s 
  user interface. The system is thus designed using the concept of a single push 
  button microphone giving describer the ability to control the entire process 
  through one button. The button is pressed once to start the broadcasting of 
  the describer&#8217;s voice and then pressed again (released) to stop the broadcast 
  (see <a href="finalreport.php.html#fig2.jpg">Figure 2</a>).
</p>
<a id="fig2" name="fig2"></a>
<a id="fig2" name="fig2"></a>
<p><img src="guidelines/images/fig18.jpg" alt="Figure 2: Describer control and status indicators." /> </p>
<p class="cap">Figure 2: Describer control and status indicators</p>

<p>During broadcasting of the describer&#8217;s voice, the system monitors the 
  sound level in the source video. If there is sound and the describer has not 
  stopped the description, the source video is automatically paused by inserting 
  frames in it and extended description can continue. Once the describer stops 
  his description, the video continues from the point where frames were inserted. 
  Visually these events appear as a video pause which may be disconcerting for 
  a sighted viewer. Again, research is required to determine the tolerance levels 
  of vision impaired and sighted user pairs for this type of video behaviour.

<h2>3. Tools for Accessible Online Collaboration</h2>

<a id="chat" name="chat"></a>
<h3>A-Chat</h3>

<p>Available at: <a href="http://achat.atrc.utoronto.ca">http://achat.atrc.utoronto.ca</a>, A-Chat is an accessible browser-based 
  chat program designed to accommodate users with differing access needs. This 
  software serves as a research platform to enable investigation of ways in which 
  common chat features might be made more accessible. The key features of A-Chat 
  are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Administrator Settings include:</li>
	<ul>
	  <li>Language</li>
	  <li>Transcript</li>
	  <li>Message/Chat/User ID lifespans</li>
	  <li>Public or private user list</li>
	  <li>Hands-up mode in which a moderator controls the &#8220;floor&#8221;</li>
	</ul>
	<li>User can login to an existing account or automatically start a new 
	  one.</li>
	<li>Accessibility related preference options are provided:</li>
	<ul>  
	  <li>Option to play sound effect when a new message arrives.</li>
	  <li>Various refresh options, including manual </li>
	  <li>Message ordering</li>
	  <li>Show only new messages</li>
	  <li>Font size, font face</li>
	  <li>Colour scheme</li>
	  <li>Navigation aids on or off</li>
	  <li>Language settings</li>
	</ul>  
	<li>Participant list with names linked to participant message history.</li>
	<li>Screen reader friendly page layout.</li>
</ul>  
  <a id="screenshots" name="screenshots"></a>
  <h4>Screenshots:</h4>
<p>The following figures illustrate how individual preferences are set in A-Chat 
  to allow customization of the appearance of the interface and the content.</p>


<a id="fig3" name="fig3"></a>

<p><img src="guidelines/images/fig4.jpg" alt="Figure 4:This screenshot shows the main A-Chat screen. The message area in on the top-left, the compose message area under it and the options and user list and history areas on the right." /> </p>
<p class="cap">Figure 4:This screenshot shows the main A-Chat screen. The message area in on the top-left, the compose message area under it and the options and user list and history areas on the right.</p>

<p>A-Chat can be used to facilitate any number of text-based collaborative activities, 
  including lectures, story-telling, tutorials, discussion groups, and other meetings. 
  Administrative options allow the chat session to be customized according to 
  the level of privacy and user participation desired. </p>

<p>The tool does not currently implement any type of warning system to let the 
  other participants know when someone is still composing a message, so users 
  of the system should remember that some users will take longer to compose and 
  send a message than others. There are several methods for minimizing the chance 
  of conversations changing topic before a person can contribute their message. 
  These include:</p>

<ul>
	<li> allowing the use of abbreviations</li>
	<li> leaving a reasonable period or getting participant assent before closing 
		a subject</li>
	<li> encouraging users to split long messages into two, with any preliminary 
		messages ending with &#8220;&#8230;&#8221; to make it clear than more is on 
		the way.</li>
	<li> controlling the &#8220;floor&#8221; either by making use of some informal 
		arrangement or using the more formal (and restrictive) A-Chat hand-raise mode.</p>
</ul>

<p>A-Chat is capable of producing text transcripts (see administrative options) 
  in the form of HTML documents. Some groups may find it useful to post these 
  files following a session in order to facilitate understanding by users who 
  may not have been able to follow all that was said.</p>
<a id="communicator" name="communicator"></a>
<h3>A-Communicator</h3>

<p>Available at: <a href="http://acomm.atrc.utoronto.ca">http://acomm.atrc.utoronto.ca</a>, A-Communicator (A-Comm) is an accessible 
  client-side Instant Messaging (IM) and Whiteboard tool developed as a research 
  platform for investigating peer description and keyboard accessible drawing. 
  A-Comm utilizes an object-oriented drawing environment, implemented with SVG. 
  This software serves as a research platform to enable investigation of some 
  design features that might ameliorate the accessibility challenges posed by 
  the display and collaborative control of graphics in whiteboards.</p>

<p>The key features of the tool are:</p>
<ul>  
  <li>User can login to an existing Jabber account or sign up for a new one.</li>
  <li>Roster provides &#8220;presence&#8221; information for contacts.</li>
  <li>Users can participate in private or group chat/whiteboard sessions.</li>
  <li>Text chat window and optional whiteboard</li>
  <li>Participant list on demand.</li>
  <li>A variety of whiteboard drawing tools are available</li>
  <ul>
	  <li>Pencil</li>
	  <li>Line tool</li>
	  <li>Rectangle tool</li>
	  <li>Ellipse tool</li>
	  <li>Line colour, fill colour, line thickness</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Peer description allows any participant to describe the drawn objects. 
  Anti-collision feature ensures one describer per object.</li>
  <li>Some accessibility related options are provided:</li>
  <ul>
	  <li>Option to play sound effect when a new message arrives.</li>
	  <li>Keyboard drawing checkbox</li>
	  <li>Manual refresh checkbox</li>
	  <li>Show only new checkbox</li>
	  <li>Newest message first checkbox</li>
  </ul>
  <li> Keyboard enabled drawing lets users use some features of the whiteboard 
  without a mouse.</li>
  <li> Save and open palette feature lets users create and describe pictures 
  beforehand.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following figure illustrates peer description of images in the collaborative 
  whiteboard space.</p>

<a id="fig5" name="fig5"></a>
<p><img src="guidelines/images/fig5.jpg" alt="Figure 5: An example of a teacher-led lesson using drawings to 
  demonstrate a concept, three students (&quot;Amanda&quot;, &quot;David&quot; 
  and &quot;Cathy&quot;) submit peer descriptions. The most recently drawn shape, 
  an ellipse has not yet been described." /> </p>
<p class="cap">Figure 5: An example of a teacher-led lesson using drawings to 
  demonstrate a concept, three students (&quot;Amanda&quot;, &quot;David&quot; 
  and &quot;Cathy&quot;) submit peer descriptions. The most recently drawn shape, 
  an ellipse has not yet been described.</p>

<p>The peer description tool allows descriptions to be added to as many or as 
  few drawing objects as describers wish. Describers may decide to describe every 
  drawing object on the screen or they may choose to ignore most of the objects 
  and focus on adding higher level descriptions of what is being drawn to just 
  a few choice drawing objects (in the future, object grouping will make this 
  distinction less important).</p>

<p>The benefit of describing every object is that users with visual disabilities 
  will have an in depth picture of the different objects being added to the whiteboard. 
  However, the drawback is that the chat may become cluttered with very repetitive 
  descriptions of low level details (e.g. describing every tiger stripe, etc.), 
  which prevents the description reader from &#8220;seeing the forest for the 
  trees&#8221;. On the other hand, placing high level descriptions on just a few 
  objects gives the user a better overview, but risks problems if the objects 
  holding the high level description are deleted or re-purposed as part of a different 
  drawing.</p>

<p>The best guidance is probably to use a combination of the two approaches. Use 
  low level descriptions, sparingly, to get across to the description reader the 
  process used to create the picture, but avoid overly repetitive description 
  of repeating features. At the same time remember to use the description of some 
  of the objects for higher level descriptions of the composition as a whole.</p>

<p>In all cases, be careful with your describing. A-Comm does not currently have 
  a method for revising descriptions once they are submitted.</p>

<p>A-Comm allows users to create and re-load batches of pre-authored (and pre-described) 
  drawing objects in the form of SVG files. Additional pre-authored SVG files 
  are also available from the A-Comm website. Note: A-Comm does not support all 
  features of SVG so do not attempt to load SVG files created by other tools.</p>

<p>This feature can be used by anyone on the chat and causes the drawing objects 
  to be placed in addition to any objects already on the whiteboard. Any descriptions 
  of objects in the SVG file will be displayed in the chat. Undescribed drawing 
  objects will be available for peer description. There is also nothing to prevent 
  this feature from being used by people with visual disabilities.</p>

<p>This feature may be useful for the following:<br />
<ul>
  <li>&#8220;Slide shows&#8221; or other planned presentations</li>
  <li>Standardized drawings (e.g. flow charts, organizational charts, etc.)</li>
  <li>Drawings that include frequently used objects (e.g. company logos, 
  arrows, etc.)</li>
</ul>  
</p>

<p>The software is programmed in Java, which enables it to be used on a variety 
  of operating system platforms.</p>

<p>Access to the Internet has changed the way we communicate, work and learn together. 
  People are now able to collaboratively author reports, presentations and undertake 
  research while working at a distance. For people with disabilities, access to 
  online collaborative tools is imperative to participating in today&#8217;s work 
  and educational environments. </p>

<p>A-Collab is an access standards compliant multi-group Web-based collaborative 
  work environment. A-Collab enables individuals to collaboratively author and 
  edit documents over the Internet accessibly. It provides users with access to 
  a shared document library, which stores relevant research and/or documentation 
  for the project and previous versions of any collaboratively authored documents. 
  The tool also provides users with access to an events calendar, as well as a 
  shared news and announcements area, and contact lists. Finally, A-Collab links 
  all users of the tool together through both an accessible synchronous chat, 
  and an accessible asynchronous threaded online discussion board. </p>

<p>A-Collab represents the only currently available fully accessible collaborative 
  tool, and is therefore an extremely important development for people with disabilities 
  who stand to greatly benefit from the advantages of electronic collaboration. 
  A-Collab is equally appropriate for both business and learning environments, 
  but can also be used to link people across distances for other uses as well. 
  For example, CNICE project administrators, partners and advisory committee members 
  successfully used an augmented version of A-Collab to communicate about project 
  deliverables, and to stay informed regarding project developments during the 
  early stages of the project.</p>

<p>It is hard to make significant contributions to the production of culture without 
  first having access to education. For students with disabilities, access to 
  science education has proved challenging. Teachers are increasingly turning 
  towards developing science skills in their students through using the myriad 
  of interactive science programs available, but frequently these programs pose 
  access issues for students with disabilities. Science software often requires 
  complex graphs, images and interactive modules. Most science programs currently 
  available lack accessible alternatives for audio and visual elements, thereby 
  making this key content unavailable to students who are deaf and/or blind. Often 
  interactive science programs also use point and click navigational structures 
  that require users to be able to operate a mouse. For students with disabilities 
  who require keyboard only access, these programs are virtually unusable.</p>
  
<p>Digital Frog International has addressed many of these design issues in the 
  development of Science Matrix. ScienceMatrix is a modularized science software 
  available online through the DFI website. Each module of ScienceMatrix has been 
  designed to be tied directly to middle and high school science curriculum requirements, 
  and can be accessed as a separate unit.</p>
  
<p>ScienceMatrix utilises hands-on interactive exercises and context sensitive 
  definitions to support students in their learning. All functionality within 
  ScienceMatrix has been designed to be accessible to all students, regardless 
  of ability. ScienceMatrix incorporates full self-voicing text-to-speech, and 
  provides audible descriptions for every image. It also ensures access for students 
  who are deaf by including captions for all video based content. Finally, ScienceMatrix 
  is fully keyboard accessible, to the extent that even students using single 
  switch access technology can also fully access all elements of the program.</p>

<p>In December 2003, DFI was presented with a World Summit Award for the Best in 
  E-Content for Science Matrix, an online accessible science-based learning resource 
  developed as part of the CNICE project. The prestigious award was presented 
  to DFI at a gala in Geneva in early December as part of the World Summit on 
  the Information Society 2003. This award speaks to the high degree of innovation 
  and creativity inherent in DFI&#8217;s e-content, and recognizes them as a world 
  leader in this field. More information about this award can be found at <a  href="http://www.europrix.org/wsis-award/">http://www.europrix.org/wsis-award/</a></p>
  
<p>ScienceMatrix provides accessible science education to students with disabilities 
  that can be accessed anytime by anyone over the Internet. More significantly 
  perhaps, it also sets the standard for the development of accessible online 
  educational tools by serving as an exemplar of what can be accomplished when 
  issues of access are considered central to the development process.</p>
 <a id="clt" name="clt"></a>
<h3>CLT Broadcast Videos</h3>
<p>CLT produced and edited two 1/2 hour broadcast videos about the CNICE project 
  during the Banff Centre&#8217;s Interactive Screen Conference in July. Part 
  I addressed the challenge of modality translation. Part II of the program outlines 
  how technological convergence can enhance accessibility to culturally oriented 
  learning objects and can promote a greater sense of inclusiveness for Canadians 
  with disabilities. Both will be broadcast on Canadian Learning Television. The 
  program will be repeated on CLT during the next quarter. The programs will also 
  be digitized for online distribution on the CNICE website.</p>

<p>The national broadcast of the program widens the public awareness of the goals 
  and objectives of CNICE and draws attention to the importance of further research 
  and development in this area.</p>
<a id="museum" name="museum"></a>
<h3>Disability Rights in Canada: A Virtual Museum</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.disabilityrightsmuseum.ca/">http://www.disabilityrightsmuseum.ca/</a></p>

<p>It was an important moment in 1970 when disability rights were added to section 
  15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Up until that point, it was 
  not illegal to discriminate against a person with a disability simply because 
  he or she was disabled. The specific events leading up to the changes to the 
  Charter are important to know and remember for both Canadians with and without 
  disabilities alike.</p>

<p>It is somewhat ironic that museums themselves may not always prove to be particularly 
  accessible to people with disabilities. Visitors to a museum may have to contend 
  with access barriers inherent in the building&#8217;s design. As well, visitors 
  who are blind and or deaf have limited access to those componants of the musuem 
  that rely on sight and/or hearing to convey information within an exhibit. </p>

<p>Disability Rights in Canada: A Virtual Museum is therefore intended to provide 
  Canadians with a rich retelling of the stories of the individuals involved in 
  the campaign to alter the charter. It includes artefacts and archival records 
  connected with the movement as a way of engaging the viewer with the struggles, 
  fears, hopes and dedication of those involved in their fight to be recognized 
  as equals under the human rights laws of Canada. Content for the museum is being 
  developed by the Canadian Centre on Disability Studies (CCDS) at the University 
  of Winnipeg. CCDS is recognized as international leaders in the field of disability 
  studies and have drawn upon considerable expertise in their development and 
  selection of appropriate images, artifacts and personal stories for inclusion 
  in the virtual museum. </p>

<p>Disability Rights in Canada: A Virtual Museum has a number of advantages over 
  traditional museums. As it is available over the Internet, the museum can be 
  visited by anyone, at anytime, who has a computer and an internet connection. 
  Unlike traditional museums, exhibits within the virtual museum have been designed 
  to be accessible to all regardless of ability. Visual elements in the exhibits 
  include text-based descriptions which can be accessed by individuals who are 
  blind. Audio elements within the museum are accompanied by captions for deaf 
  and/or hard of hearing users accessing the exhibits. Navigation through the 
  site is possible using keyboard only access; an important consideration for 
  users of the site with physical disabilities. Through these and other innovative 
  design features, people with disabilities are free to interact with and explore 
  a rich repository of information about the development of disability culture 
  in Canada. </p>

<p>They say that those who fail to understand the past may be doomed to repeat 
  it. Disability Rights in Canada: A Virtual Museum is an important step in ensuring 
  that people with disabilities retain their hard won successes in the fight for 
  disability rights in Canada. <br />

<h2>5. MERLO</h2>
<p>The MERLO (meaning equivalence reusable learning objects) project (<a href="http://merlo.rcat.utoronto.ca">http://merlo.rcat.utoronto.ca</a>) 
  builds on meaning equivalence theory to develop an assessment method that probes 
  the individual&#8217;s deep comprehension of the content material based on their 
  judgements about the surface similarity and meaning equivalence of statements. 
  The tests are scored to provide both a global score and a partial score that 
  includes information about correct answers and incorrect selections. This method 
  of assessment is particularly useful for individuals who are being tested in 
  a second language and individuals who have learning disabilities because it 
  probes knowledge through multiple representations of an object. The scores reflect 
  where a student is making connections of meaning as well as where they are making 
  incorrect judgements. During the CNICE project, MERLO were developed for assessment 
  of ESL Spatial prepositions and for Canadian Architecture History. The assessments 
  were used in educational settings at Ryerson University and George Brown College. 
  Initial results lend support to claims that </p>
  
<ol>
	<li>MERLO enhance learning outcomes not only by helping instructors to focus 
		on conceptual knowledge, but also by providing learners with feedback from self-tests 
		that is immediate, accurate, detailed, and focuses on 'soft conceptual spots' 
		in need of reinforcement and remediation.</li>
	<li>In lively follow-up class discussions that focus on meaning, the roles of 
		instructors and students are often switched; building blocks of concepts are 
		described, analyzed, and clarified.</li>
	<li>ME/RLO provide valuable diagnostic information regarding difficulties in understanding 
		aspects of English text by ESL and reading disabled students;</li>
	<li>MERLO is effective across different populations of instructors and learners 
		and across disciplines.</li>
	<li>MERLO is technologically scalable.</li>
</ol>

<p>The MERLO project developed algorithms for creating meaning equivalence assessments 
  and these algorithms can be used in any field of study.</p>
<a id="6" name="6"></a>
<h2>6. Theme: Training, Education, Mentoring and Evaluation</h2>

<p>Full participation in culture-building is reliant upon opportunities to build 
  skills, gain knowledge and share experience. For example, artists usually work 
  hard at their craft: they practice the requisite skills, learn about techniques 
  and concepts in their field and work with other artists to contribute to the 
  development of their field and own style. These same kinds of activities are 
  important to individuals participating in construction of a cultural identity 
  or participating in culture in more general ways. Naturally, any movement to 
  make culture and culture-building accessible must include these kinds of opportunities 
  to train, learn and collaborate. </p>

<p>CNICE included several projects that enabled individuals with disabilities 
  to participate in culture through online technologies. Canadian Abilities Foundation 
  (CAF) worked in this area in three ways: 1) development of Access Guide Canada, 
  2) networking to develop artist mentoring opportunities and 3) hosting of an 
  online version of the Connections Gallery exhibit. The Canadian Hearing Society 
  (CHS) and Canadian Cultural Society of the Deaf (CCSD) collected individual 
  stories and experiences at the Summer Institute of the World Federation of the 
  Deaf 2003 Conference. The Centre for Research in Disability Studies (CRDS) developed 
  two networks that enabled participants usually excluded from online activities 
  to learn about online technology to collaborate and communicate with other participants. 
  </p>
<a id="sum" name="sum"></a>  
<h3>Project Summaries</h3>

<p>Following is a description of project activities and achievements over the course 
  of the CNICE project.</p>
<a id="accessguide" name="accessguide"></a>
<h3>Access Guide Canada</h3>
<p>The mandate of Access Guide Canada is to provide information about accessible 
  place, events and venues across Canada. As part of CNICE, focus was placed on 
  development of the entertainment listings. Individuals who visit the Access 
  Guide Canada web site (www.abilities.ca/agc), are able to conduct searches by 
  community to learn about the accessibility of an event or to add an accessibility 
  rating or information about an event/venue. A check of the entertainment listing 
  would provide the individual with information about accessible live music, theatres, 
  galleries and museums in addition to other forms of entertainment. Individuals, 
  particularly those with disabilities are encouraged to continue to upload information 
  about accessibility in their community to the database. This ongoing growth 
  in knowledge about accessible cultural events enables individuals who are travelling 
  to new regions or staying close to home to plan activities that will be inclusive 
  for them and to reward organizations and organizers who make their sites and 
  events accessible. Access Guide Canada will continue to grow and develop on 
  the EnableLink site now that CNICE has come to an end.</p>

<a id="arts" name="arts"></a> 
<h3>Arts Mentoring Opportunities</h3>
<p>As part of its CNICE work to develop training and mentoring opportunities, CAF, 
  increased the listings of the Arts section on the EnableLink website. The EnableLink 
  art section menu points to a list of 62 articles written on arts and disability, 
  three external links, a listing of twenty-eight disability organizations concerned 
  with the arts, and ten links to international disability and arts organizations. 
  This section also features a chat room and a message board. Both of these have 
  been implemented to encourage collaboration and mentorship between individuals 
  around matters related to disability and arts. Additionally, CAF used opportunities 
  such as the Abilities Festival Connections event and partnerships in CNICE (e.g. 
  Banff New Media Institute) to gather contact information from artists willing 
  to mentor other artists who have disabilities. This documentation will be used 
  to populate the database for an online system that will enable learners and 
  mentors to be matched.</p>
<a id="connections" name="connections"></a>
<h3>Connections Exhibit &amp; Online Gallery</h3>
<p>As part of the Abilities Festival, CAF hosted an exhibition of work by disabled 
  artists at a Toronto Gallery. Attendees were surveyed about accessibility of 
  the event, their interest in online galleries, and their willingness to be mentors. 
  From this exhibit, an online exhibit of the works (many now sold to private 
  collectors) was created (<a href="http://www.enablelink.org/abilitiesfestival">www.enablelink.org/abilitiesfestival</a>). The online gallery 
  contains accessible information about the art work and the artist. The next 
  step planned for the gallery will be to include modality translations of the 
  works based on guidelines developed in the CNICE project. </p>
<a id="deaf" name="deaf"></a>
<h3>Deaf Summer Institute</h3>
<p>In collaboration with other CNICE partners, CHS participated in the Deaf Summer 
  Institute at the 2003 World Federation of the Deaf World Congress in Montreal. 
  Young people who are deaf conducted interviews with other congress participants 
  and gathered content such as jokes and stories that speak to the collective 
  cultural identity of individuals who are deaf. This material has been made available 
  on the web at <a href="http://www.aslpah.ca">www.aslpah.ca</a>. This extraordinary site uses mini-movies to create 
  ASL links and utilizes icons that are relevant to the deaf signing community. 
  English is also provided on the site so that hearing individuals are also able 
  to share in this expression of deaf culture. For individuals who are deaf, this 
  site represents a leap into online culture-building in that it acknowledges 
  and stems from deaf culture, a vibrant culture that is often neglected relative 
  to other cultural identities from the hearing world. </p>
<a id="family" name="family"></a>
<h3>Family Voices Leadership Network</h3>
<p>The Family Leadership Network is a composition of five smaller networks distributed 
  among several Alberta locations. The network participants are parents of developmentally 
  disabled children. During the course of the CNICE project, participants were 
  provided high speed connections, conferencing tools, technical support and training 
  on the technology and tools provided. The goal was to facilitate communication 
  and networking among this group to help build a sense of community and shared 
  experience amongst participants. Additionally, CRDS wanted to create an environment 
  where individuals could mentor each other. This network was also planned as 
  a test bed for tools and concepts developed in the CNICE project. However, this 
  plan was abandoned out of concern that problems inherent in beta soft-ware would 
  be off-putting to this group of new computer users and interfere with growth 
  of the network interactions. This decision turned out to be a wise choice since 
  other technical issue inhibited the network growth through much of the project. 
  In order to further encourage this network, participants will have continued 
  access to the communication tools for at least two months after the close of 
  the project. Additionally, participants will have access to CNICE collaborative 
  tools developed during the project and made freely available on the CNICE website.</p>
<a id="treaty" name="treaty"></a>
<h3>Treaty Seven Disabled Community Network</h3>
<p>The Treaty Seven Network goal was to work with the Disability committee providing 
  computer literacy and basic productivity skills in preparation for the committee 
  taking on a community education project. This network for Treaty Seven disabled 
  members is especially important due to the wide geographical distribution of 
  its members, and the lack of available technology for special needs accessibility. 
  During the CNICE project, a network was established and the instruction and 
  technology required for basic computer use was provided. These activities were 
  the first step in a longer process to allow information exchange, training and 
  mentoring to widely dispersed native persons with disabilities that will continue 
  after the end of the CNICE project.</p>

<p>This network was a great success and has generated interest from disabled groups 
  in other Treaty communities. One success of the project has been the GPS-based 
  mapping of two communities (Calagary &amp; Pikani) showing cultural and educational 
  landmarks. These maps will include links to video material that will be made 
  fully accessible using the CapScribe tool developed by CNICE partner Ryerson 
  University. This network was also used to test accessibility concepts and software 
  strategies developed by CNICE partner Digital Frog International. Computer productivity 
  training provided as part of the CNICE project and community cultural mapping 
  will continue in these communities after the close of the CNICE project.<br />
<a id="7" name="7"></a>
<h2>7. Evaluation Work</h2>
<p>Several evaluations were conducted during the CNICE project. Many of the iterative 
  evaluations were carried out individually by project partners or in consultation 
  with the ATRC. These evaluations provided information about accessibility concepts, 
  existing attitudes in the arts and new media community and tool usability. All 
  of these evaluations were used to inform tool development, guidelines development 
  and project goals. Evaluations included participants from the CNICE Advisory 
  Panel, artists, producers, developers and consumers. A summative evaluation 
  of the project was also carried out to determine how well the network met specific 
  success markers and facilitated communication amongst partners. The results 
  of this evaluation are presented in the following section.<p>
<a id="sumeval" name="sumeval"></a>
<h3>CNICE Summative Evaluation</h3>
<p>The CNICE summative evaluation began with collaboration amongst the partners 
  at the start of the project to establish project success markers. These markers 
  were partnerships, communication opportunities, consumer participation, project 
  implementation and dissemination and meeting deliverables. The evaluation involved 
  an online survey that was distributed to all CNICE partners. Twenty individuals 
  submitted responses; seven were researchers, five were project coordinators 
  and the rest had other roles.</p>
<a id="partnership" name="partnership"></a>
<h3>Partnerships</h3>
<p>In this project, we wanted to create a true network where partners exchanged 
  ideas, utilized each other&#8217;s expertise and began further collaborations 
  outside of the original project. Only one of the respondents indicated that 
  he/she did not consult directly with another CNICE partner. Of those who did, 
  7 consulted with 9 or more individuals from partner organizations and 8 consulted 
  with 4-8 individuals. Of particular note is the report by 19 of the respondents 
  that they integrated tools or suggestions made by other CNICE partners into 
  their projects. All of the respondents indicated that the connections they made 
  through CNICE were useful and 19 intend to maintain these connections after 
  the close of the project. Indeed, 13 of the respondents indicated that they 
  had formed new project partnerships with a CNICE partner. Collaboration is critical 
  to address effectively the multi-faceted challenge of creating accessible online 
  culture. CNICE has shown itself to be a true network in which the collective 
  skills and knowledge are greater than the sum of its parts. </p>
<a id="communication" name="communication"></a>
<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>Similarly, communication amongst Network projects was critical for the overall 
  success of the project. Of the 20 respondents, 15 indicated that they communicated 
  with partners at least on a monthly basis and of that group, 9 communicated 
  with partners on a weekly basis. These frequent communications enabled the partners 
  build the generated guidelines from a collective knowledge space. The project 
  utilized four main communications methods: web site, online forums, chats, face 
  to face meetings. The weekly chats and face to face meetings were rated the 
  most favourably by CNICE partners. The least favourite form of communication 
  was the web site which indicates that the partners preferred active forms of 
  communication over static forms.</p>
<a id="participation" name="participation"></a>
<h3>Consumer Participation</h3>

<p>CNICE partners were particularly concerned with having a participatory design 
  model and encourage this approach in the developed guidelines. This approach 
  acknowledges the design wisdom to be gained from multiple sources, especially 
  from consumers or target users. Figure 6, indicates the multiple ways that network 
  projects involved consumers.</p>

<a id="fig6" name="fig6"></a> 
<p><img src="guidelines/images/involvegraph.gif" alt="images/involvegraph.gif" /> </p>
<p class="cap"></p>
<a id="implement" name="implement"></a>
<h3>Implementation &amp; Dissemination</h3>
<p>Numerous service gaps were identified by network partners. Of these gaps, six 
  partners reported that they were able to address all of the gaps they identified 
  while 8 partners addressed some of the gaps. Only one partner reported that 
  they did not address the gap they had identified. Respondents reported that 
  they were able to include consumer opinion and advice from the outset of their 
  projects and throughout an iterative design process. Partners indicate that 
  they have begun to disseminate project results through conferences, speaking 
  engagements, academic papers, web sites, news media and other channels. </p>
<a id="evalconc" name="evalconc"></a>
<h3>Evaluation Conclusion</h3>
<p>The CNICE project functioned as a network should: partners worked collaboratively, 
  project directions and designs were influenced by these collaborations and ongoing 
  partnerships and connections were made. Functioning networks are vital to the 
  development of wide reaching concepts and guidelines such as those developed 
  in the CNICE project. Even amongst like-minded organizations, it can be difficult 
  to maintain lines of communication once project task demands increase. CNICE 
  partners attended weekly online chats and used these chats as a forum to discuss 
  issues, to discuss new developments or achievements, to share tools and to strategies 
  on shared deliverables. Finding the best mode for communication amongst a network 
  was critical.</p>

<h2>Conclusion and Future Directions</h2>
<p>The Canadian Network for Inclusive Cultural Exchange (CNICE) brought together 
  consumer groups and researchers in the field of inclusive design to create guidelines 
  for making Canadian cultural content on-line accessible to people with disabilities. 
  CNICE also produced tools and environments needed for inclusive cultural exchange 
  on-line. However guidelines are only as valuable as their implementation. An 
  initiative is required to broadly publicize the products of CNICE and engage 
  artists and content producers in applying the guidelines, tools and environments 
  as a framework for innovation. The project will encourage producers of cultural 
  content to expand their notion and definition of &#8220;the audience&#8221; 
  or &#8220;the user&#8221; to include members with a broad range of abilities, 
  thereby also expanding their art-form.</p>

<p>Accessible design as an afterthought or add-on is costly and frequently appears 
  contrived or poorly connected. Partners within the project will collaborate 
  to integrate inclusive design into the workflow of on-line cultural content 
  production, from the initial design stages and throughout the process. </p>

<p>One issue, identified in the CNICE project, that requires further research 
  is the issue of creating accurate equivalent alternatives. To provide access 
  to rich media, the message conveyed in a modality that is inaccessible to certain 
  audience members, is interpreted into an alternative modality. This includes 
  creating captions or sign translations for people who are deaf or hard of hearing 
  and creating audio descriptions for people who are blind. This is a relatively 
  straightforward process when the content is educational or purely informational. 
  The same cannot be said for cultural content. Art, whatever form it takes, cannot 
  be a solitary or constrained activity. The perception, thoughts and emotions 
  of the audience are as much the artist&#8217;s medium as the paint, the music 
  or the dance. As such it is an unpredictable medium influenced by the myriad 
  of experiences and the cultural contexts of the viewer. If we add interpretation 
  from one sensory modality to another to this complex mix of interactions we 
  can strive to provide an accessible equivalent interpretation but we can never 
  truly achieve this. This is not a bad thing, nor does it mean that we cannot 
  hope to provide equal access in the arts. It spurs us to explore our perceptions, 
  our points of view and the great diversity of the human experience as well as 
  the core elements that we all share. We come to realize that there is no equivalency, 
  no uniform perception or interpretation among audience members who have no disability. 
  This diversity can be seen as an asset, not a deficit. CNICE participants felt 
  that the question is not how can someone with a disability have the same experience 
  but how can the experience of someone with a disability be as rich and evocative 
  as the experience of the individual without a disability. A related question 
  is how can the person with a disability feel they have shared in the collective 
  experience of the artwork or performance? Through InCNet the partners will develop 
  models of best practice that respond to these questions in the various on-line 
  media.</p>
