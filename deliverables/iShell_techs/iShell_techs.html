<H2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</H2>
<P>Tribeworks iShell is a multimedia authoring and development program for both 
Windows and Macintosh platforms. Its uses range from streaming video and virtual 
reality tours to interactive kiosks, custom MP3 players and video games. iShell 
documents are well suited to being distributed across the Internet as well as 
standalone programs on CD or DVD-ROM. With this techniques document and the 
iShell accessibility package from DFI, it will be possible to create 
cross-platform accessible media for nearly any purpose. This document assumes a 
working knowledge of the iShell authoring tool and, for those checkpoints and 
methods which reference the DFI AT plug-in, a working knowledge of that software 
as well. Some checkpoints and methods reference W3C techniques documents. These 
documents are created by the W3C group and are referenced in good faith.
<H2><a name="guidelines"></a>A. Techniques</H2>
<H2 class=guide><a name="perceivable"></a>Guideline 1 - Ensure all content is 
  Perceivable.</H2>

<H4><a name="t11" id="t11"></a>checkpoint 1.1 - All non-text content that can 
  be expressed in words has a text equivalent of the function or information that 
  the non-text content was intended to convey. [core] </H4>
<P>(<A class=techniques 
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#text-equiv">Checkpoint Description for 
Checkpoint 1.1</A>)</P><P>There are several ways to provide text alternates for 
non-text content in iShell. <BR><BR><B>Method 1</B>: You can use HTML to include 
your images into an iShell document. When using HTML, use the <I>alt</I> element 
in the <I>img</I> tag for text equivalent. Longdescs may also be desirable in 
some cases. For more information, see the <A 
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-HTML-TECHS/#image-text-equivalent">HTML 
Techniques for checkpoint 1.1</A>.<BR><BR><B>Method 2</B>: It is relatively 
simple in iShell to apply a 'Mouse Idle' event to images in a document which can 
then be given a command to pop up a dialog containing the text alternate. A 
mouse leave event on the image can be set to dismiss the dialog. The down-side 
of this method is that other uses of Mouse Idle or Mouse Leave may be interfered 
with.<BR><BR><B>Method 3</B>: Using the DFI AT plug-in, ensure that every image 
is included in the Tab Handler list (for more information on setting up a Tab 
Handler, see <A 
href="#t2_1">Techniques for 
Checkpoint 2.1</A>). Once the Tab Handler list is properly set up, a single 
keyboard event is used to capture any presses of the 'd' key (using 'd' as a 
trigger for alternate descriptions should be considered a normative standard). 
These key presses then launch either a spoken description of the content or a 
text dialog as described in Method 2, or both. Using the Speak command from the 
DFI AT plug-in will, when directed towards an image object, automatically speak 
the contents of a text file which has the same name as the image, only with the 
'.txt' extension (example: the text description for 'picture.png' will be stored 
in 'picture.txt' in the same directory). These text files must be manually 
created.</P>

<P><B>Example</B></P>
<P><B>Method 3</B>: This <A 
href="images/4.jpg">screenshot</A> shows an example of three images in a project, 
  all of which have been referenced by a Tab Handler. It also shows how a Speak 
  command with the pointer set to Current Focus can deal with all three images 
  at once. Not shown are the three text files which follow the naming convention 
  detailed above.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H4><a name="t12" id="t12"></a>checkpoint 1.2 - Synchronized media equivalents 
  are provided for time-dependent presentations. [core] </H4>
<P>(<A class=techniques 
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#media-equiv">Checkpoint Description for 
Checkpoint 1.2</A>)</P><P>Neither the base iShell authoring tool nor the DFI AT 
plug-in currently support <A class=glosslink 
href="#gloss-SMIL">SMIL</A>, 
which is the ideal system for captioning and other synchronized media. 
Hopefully, this will change in future versions. In the meantime, there are 
various alternate methods.<BR><BR><B>Method 1</B>: Movies can be captioned 
externally in the original media(i.e. Quicktime, Real, etc.). This adds 
simplicity but is lacking in flexibility. For further instructions, see the 
reference manual for the authoring tool in question.<BR><BR><B>Method 2</B>: For 
each Movie object on the screen, create a caption Text field. Within the movie, 
set various Time events, one for each caption. In each Time event, create a Tell 
command which changes the contents of the caption field to the desired caption. 
If there is a long time between captions, a Time event with an empty Tell 
command should be used to clear the caption field. This method can also be used 
for synchronized speech or sound by using a Time event with either a Speak 
command (using the DFI AT plug-in) or a Sound command. The disadvantage of this 
method is that, while a Movie object in iShell need not be tied directly to a 
specific clip, the captions will be. When using this method it is important to 
remember not to switch different movies into the same Movie object. A simple way 
to work around this is to create an iShell project file containing movie and 
captions both for each clip you use and to, when movie switching is desired, 
accommodate for both the movie and the caption field and switch in iShell 
projects rather than movie clips.</P>

<P><B>Example</B></P>
<P><B>Method 2</B>: This <A 
href="images/7.jpg">screenshot</A> shows an example of a movie and a caption field. 
  There are three time events in the movie each of which places a new caption 
  in the Text field named "Caption."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H4><a name="t13"></a>checkpoint 1.3 - Both [information/substance] and structure 
  are separable from presentation. [core] </H4>
<P>(<A class=techniques 
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#content-structure-separation">Checkpoint 
Description for Checkpoint 1.3</A>)</P>
<P>Currently there is no way to extract all textual/informational content from 
  an iShell document in a way which preserves structure. Any information which 
  is stored in a plain-text file and then used via a Text field is easily accessible 
  although its relationship to other elements in the document can not be programmatically 
  determined. Hopefully, future versions of iShell will support exporting or extracting 
  of text content. Alternately, future versions of the DFI AT plug-in may support 
  direct piping of spoken content to a socket or interface in plain-text. In the 
  meantime, the best practise is to put as much textual content as possible into 
  text files rather than iShell internal labels as the latter are much harder 
  to extract.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H4><a name="t14"></a>checkpoint 1.4 - All characters and words in the content 
  can be unambiguously decoded. [core] </H4>
<P>(<A class=techniques 
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#unambiguous-decoding">Checkpoint Description 
for Checkpoint 1.4</A>)</P>
<P>iShell outputs Unicode by default. It is a normative suggestion that all text 
  and HTML documents used in an iShell project be encoded in Unicode whenever 
  possible. This will satisfy checkpoint 1.4 automatically by means of Unicode 
  being the de facto standard. In situations where Unicode is insufficient or 
  undesirable, there is no programmatic way to declare the method of encoding. 
  A visible message indicating the style of encoding may be desirable but is not 
  required. Hopefully, future versions of iShell will address this.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H4><a name="t15"></a>checkpoint 1.5 - Structure has been made perceivable to 
  more people through presentation(s), positioning, and labels. [extended] </H4>
<P>(<A class=techniques 
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#structure-emphasis">Checkpoint Description 
for Checkpoint 1.5</A>)</P><P>It is important to ensure that the structural and 
navigational elements of the document can be easily distinguished from the 
content elements. You can identify the transition from structure to content with 
various types of cues, including color, position and visual style (font, text 
size, etc.). When creating buttons or links in an iShell document be sure to use 
already existing metaphors to distinguish content from structure. For example, 
use buttons with the raised "3-D" appearance and use color and underlining to 
identify text links. Furthermore, it is important to <I>not</I> use these 
metaphors for reasons of presentation. Do not use in-line underlining and color 
change for purposes of emphasis, for example, as this will confuse users into 
believing that these elements should be hyperlinks.</P>
<P>Also, the visual (and audio) structural layout of a document should not change 
  as you navigate. It is important that both the position and appearance of navigational 
  and structural elements remain consistent within the document.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H4><a name="t16"></a>checkpoint 1.6 - Foreground content is easily differentiable 
  from background for both auditory and visual default presentations. [extended] 
</H4>
<P>(<A class=techniques 
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#visual-audio-contrast">Checkpoint Description 
for Checkpoint 1.6</A>)</P>
<P>When including both foreground and background elements in an iShell document 
  (i.e. when one element is appearing in front of another) ensure that the foreground 
  information is clearly differentiable from and perceivable despite the background 
  information. Specifically, test that the foreground content is still perceivable 
  in 256 shade grayscale. When using a background image which includes a wide 
  range of color values ensure that the alpha channel is set to at least 40%. 
  This will cause the background image to become increasingly transparent and 
  thus blend into the document background color and be less obtrusive or distracting. 
  Also, there should be a prominent "disable background images" button in any 
  document where the possibility of interference between background image and 
  foreground content exists. When including audio information, ensure that foreground 
  sounds are at least 20db(roughly 4 times) louder than background sounds.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2 class=guide><a name="operable"></a>Guideline 2 - Ensure that Interface Elements 
  in the Content are Operable by Any User.</H2>

<H4><a name="t21"></a>checkpoint 2.1 - All functionality is operable at a minimum 
  through a keyboard or a keyboard interface. [core] </H4>
<P>(<A class=techniques 
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#keyboard-operation">Checkpoint Description 
for Checkpoint 2.1</A>)</P><P>iShell is primarily mouse driven by default. Using the DFI 
AT plug-in to create a Tab Handler object in the root document will allow for 
basic keyboard navigation. The Tab Handler itself simply captures any depresses 
of the "tab" key. In order for the Tab handler to intelligently navigate the 
document, a Loaded event must be added to the Tab Handler. One Tab command for 
each tabbable item in the document must then by added to the Loaded event. Each 
Tab command takes an Object parameter which must refer to another object in the 
document. The order in which the Tab commands appear in the Tab Handler list 
will dictate the order of tabbing through the page. In order to meet this 
checkpoint, every element which supports mouse interaction must appear on the 
Tab Handler list. Note that, if Checkpoint 1.1 is being satisfied using Method 
3, all images must also appear on the Tab Handler list. The Tab Handler by 
default duplicates the Mouse Enter event upon first tabbing to an object and the 
Mouse Up event when "enter" is pressed. If more complicated Mouse events are 
used in a project, other methods may have to be employed to provide keyboard 
equivalents. One such possible method is to redefine the mouse events duplicated 
tab events. These parameters are defined in the properties dialog for the Tab 
Handler object. Another method for providing more sophisticated keyboard 
interaction is to add Tab Event events into the specific object which requires 
alternate interaction. By changing the parameters of the Tab Event, it is 
possible to redefine the way tabbing is handled for a single object while 
leaving the rest unchanged. Finally, more sophisticated keyboard interaction can 
also be achieved by adding further Keyboard events to the Tab Handler and 
defining behavior for other specific keypresses (as was done for "d" in the 
example attached to Checkpoint 1.1).</P>

<P><B>Example</B></P>
<P><B>Tab Handler</B>: This <A 
href="images/8.jpg">screenshot</A> shows an example of how a Tab Handler might 
  look which contains three Tab commands, each associated with an Image object 
  in the project.</P>
<P><B>Example</B></P>
<P><B>Redefining Tab Events</B>: This <A 
href="images/9.jpg">screenshot</A> shows an example of a Tab Event being used 
  to change the Tab Enter behavior of a single Image object to toggle visibility 
  of the image. This would have no effect on or relation to any Mouse Enter event 
  which may also be defined for the object. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H4><a name="t22"></a>checkpoint 2.2 - Users can control any time limits on their 
  reading, interaction, or responses unless control is not possible due to nature 
  of real time events or competition. [core] </H4>
<P>(<A class=techniques 
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#time-limits">Checkpoint Description for 
Checkpoint 2.2</A>)</P><P>For every element in an iShell document which uses the 
duration attribute as a timer there must be some easily perceivable indication 
of the fact that a timer is running and a simple way (preferably a "stop timer" 
or "I need more time" button) to stop the timer or lengthen the duration. If 
multiple timers are running at one and elements will move or appear and 
disappear dependent upon timers or time-dependent user responses there must be a 
"pause" or "stop all timers" button. In extreme cases, a "step forward" button 
may also be necessary which will increment all timers by some small amount with 
each click.</P>
<P>The exception to these rules is in cases where the content is streaming from 
  a live source or when the interaction is inherently time-dependent because of 
  the actions of external parties, such as a multi-player game or online auction.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H4><a name="t23"></a>checkpoint 2.3 - User can avoid experiencing screen flicker. 
  [core] </H4>
<P>(<A class=techniques 
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#flicker">Checkpoint Description for 
Checkpoint 2.3</A>)</P>
<P>Do not cause screen flicker (which can be symptomatic of rapid background or 
  color changes) in the range of 3 to 49 Hz. In effect, do not have the screen 
  dramatically change color or brightness at a rate equal to or higher than three 
  times per second.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H4><a name="t24"></a>checkpoint 2.4 - Structure and/or alternate navigation mechanisms 
  have been added to facilitate orientation and movement in content. [extended] 
</H4>
<P>(<A class=techniques 
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#navigation-mechanisms">Checkpoint Description 
for Checkpoint 2.4</A>)</P>
<P>When a document grows to great length (in excess of 50,000 words or 50 perceived 
  pages) the author must include internal navigation mechanisms within the content. 
  For example, if a document contains a scrolling text field which holds 50 pages 
  of text, the author should delineate it into pages and/or chapters and provide 
  a linking mechanism (such as a button) which will allow the user to jump directly 
  to the beginning of the next chapter without scrolling.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H4><a name="t25"></a>checkpoint 2.5 - Methods are provided to minimize error 
  and provide graceful recovery. [extended] </H4>
<P>(<A class=techniques 
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#minimize-error">Checkpoint Description for 
Checkpoint 2.5</A>)</P><P>In any situation where user input is required and 
unacceptable or unexpected input is given, an iShell document must generate an 
error rather than failing silently. The error report should be informative but 
unobtrusive. In situations where a large amount of user input is required (such 
as extensive text input) a more comprehensive form of error catching (such as a 
spell checker) may be required.</P>
<P>Also, in any situation where a user's selection could 
cause an irreversible change such as deleting a file, a confirmation dialog must 
exist. In programs where such confirmations may be annoying or obtrusive, it is 
acceptable to include a user preference which allows the confirmation to be 
disabled. 
<P>iShell automatically handles run-time errors with a pop-up 
box. Using the <A 
href="#appendix-nav">nav.xd</A> 
meta document, it is possible to over-ride errors by including an error event. 
Note that this will suppress the default behavior.</P>

<P><B>Example</B></P>
<P><B>Error Handler</B>: This <A 
href="images/10.jpg">screenshot</A> shows an example of 
how a Error Handler might look which contains an DFI AT plug-in Speak command to 
speak out loud the error text which would normally appear in an iShell generated 
pop-up. For this method to work, it must be contained in a <A 
href="#appendix-nav">nav.xd</A> 
style meta document. The Key Handler element which appears above the Error event 
is part of the <A 
href="#appendix-nav">nav.xd</A> 
functionality and is not related to the Error Handler. </P><BR>
<H2 class=guide><a name="understandable"></a>Guideline 3 - Make content and controls 
  understandable to as many users as possible.</H2>

<H4><a name="t31"></a>checkpoint 3.1 - Language of content can be programmatically 
  determined. [core] </H4>
<P>(<A class=techniques 
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#language">Checkpoint Description for 
Checkpoint 3.1</A>)</P><P>There is no innate capability in iShell to 
programmatically determine the language of content. To achieve partial 
compliance with this checkpoint, use HTML when including a text object into an 
iShell project. When using HTML, use the relevant HTML techniques for this 
checkpoint, such as the lang attribute.</P>

<P><B>HTML</B></P>
<P>&lt;p lang="en/us"&gt;Here is a paragraph which is in American English except

<H4><a name="t32" id="t32"></a>checkpoint 3.2 - The definition of abbreviations 
  and acronyms can be unambiguously determined. [extended] </H4>
<P>(<A class=techniques 
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#acronym-abbr-def">Checkpoint Description for 
Checkpoint 3.2</A>)</P><P>iShell does not support an innate definition/expansion 
scheme, but there are several methods for incorporating such a scheme into 
iShell.<BR><BR><B>Method 1</B>: Create an empty text field somewhere in your 
document. Creating a text field at the bottom of the document can function as a 
status bar and also be used for satisfying other checkpoints such as <A 
href="#t1_1">Checkpoint 1.1</A>. 
Once this text field has been created, you can create each acronym or 
abbreviation as a separate label and use a mouse event to send a Tell Field 
command to the status bar with the expansion text. This method is not 
recommended but is included for the sake of completion.<BR><BR><B>Method 2</B>: 
The iShell HTML parser does not currently support the ABBR and ACRONYM tags. 
However, if you use HTML to include all your textual content, you can use these 
tags (as described in the HTML techniques document) to specify definitions and 
expansions. Although this will not be readily accessible in current versions of 
iShell, the information will be programmatically available and will hopefully be 
taken advantage of by future, more compliant versions of 
iShell.<BR><BR><B>Method 3</B>: Using RTF (Rich Text Format) to encode your 
documents, format all acronyms and abbreviations and Strike-Through. Immediately 
following each acronym or abbreviation, include the expansion or definition 
formatted as Invisible. When imported into iShell, this formatting system will 
be automatically interpreted as Hot Text. Create a status bar Text field (as in 
Method 1) and use a Hot Text event within the Text object which is sensitive to 
a mouse event. Within the Hot Text event, include a Tell Field command which 
writes the value of the Hot Text to the status bar field. A single event (or 
pair of events) can handle all instances of Hot Text within an RTF document.</P>

<P><B>Example</B></P>
<P><B>Method 3</B>: This <A 
href="images/11.jpg">screenshot</A> shows an example of how an RTF document containing 
  Hot Text can be set up with two Hot Text events. The first event sets the content 
  of a Text field to the value of the Hot Text on Mouse Enter. The second event 
  resets the contents of the field to an empty string on Mouse Leave.</P>

<P>iShell makes it possible to make use of various other technologies in your 
  projects. When using technologies such as HTML or RTF, ensure that your usage 
  of these technologies meets existing standards and specifications. Specifically, 
  when using HTML, you should state which <A 
href="http://www.w3.org/">w3c</A> HTML specification you are using (HTML 4.0, 
  XHTML transitional, etc.) and ensure that you do so properly. Also, when using 
  HTML you should ensure that your HTML meets WCAG 2.0 standards. Consult the 
  HTML techniques document for further information.</P>

which is sufficient technology with which to view almost all information which 
might be encoded in an iShell document. The only external technology which is 
commonly relied upon by iShell is the Quicktime Media Player. Quicktime is 
readily and easily available. If you are distributing your project in CD form, 
you can include the latest Quicktime player on the CD. If you are distributing 
over the Internet, the iShell Runtime Environment will automatically inform the 
user of where the player can be downloaded from.</P>
<P>If your project requires any other external technology, ensure that the technology 
  is readily available and provide instructions for acquiring the technology if 
  the user does not already have it.</P>

<H4>nav.xd - an accessibility document for inclusion in iShell 
projects.</H4>
<P>Many accessibility functionalities in iShell are global to an entire project. 
  It makes much more sense to abstract these functionalities out to a document 
  which can then be included in every other document in the project than it would 
  to unnecessarily do the same work many times.<BR>
  <BR>
  The two primary uses of nav.xd are for error catching and key catching. For 
  example, if you are using the DFI ART-plugin and would like to use the Text-to-Speech 
  engine, the nav.xd approach allows you to provide one simple functionality for 
  turning TTS on and off. All you need to do is include a Key Handler element 
  in nav.xd which then contains a Keyboard event. Normatively, the standard for 
  turning TTS on and off in iShell projects is a single press of the 't' key. 
  Beneath the Keyboard event which captures the 't' keypress, include an If-Else 
  command which detects the current TTS state and then activates a SpeechPrefs 
  command to change the value. This <A 
href="images/6.jpg">screenshot</A> shows what a TTS toggle should ideally look 
  like in nav.xd.<BR>
  <BR>
  Likewise, you can include any global keyboard functionality in nav.xd using 
  similar methods. Also, error catching (as described in <A 
href="#t2_5">the techniques for checkpoint 2.5</A> and shown in <A 
href="images/10.jpg">this screenshot</A>) can be handled best by being abstracted 
  into the nav.xd document.<BR>
  <BR>
  Once the nav.xd document is completed, simply include it in every other document 
  as a root level element. It is important that nav.xd always be the LAST element 
  in the list. <A href="images/3.jpg">This screenshot</A> shows an example of 
  nav.xd properly included in a iShell document. </P>
